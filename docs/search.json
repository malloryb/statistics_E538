    "text": "1.1 On the Importance of Statistics in Environmental Science\nMany students come into statistics classes with a mix of nerves and low expectations. It is not always the most eagerly anticipated part of an environmental science degree. But statistics is one of the most important tools we have for understanding complex systems. Environmental data are messy: ecosystems shift, climate varies, and our judgments are often biased. Without statistical methods we risk telling convenient stories. With them, we can detect real patterns, test competing explanations, and make stronger arguments for environmental decisions.",

    "text": "1.1.1 Why we need Statistics: Bias and Simpson’s Paradox\nCommon sense is useful, but it is prone to bias. When we already believe something to be true, we are more likely to interpret new evidence as supporting it, even if it does not. This tendency can lead us astray in environmental science.\nFor example, if you see sick fish downstream of a factory, you might conclude that the factory caused it. For example, if you are convinced that industrial farming is the main driver of bee declines, you might see every new drop in bee abundance as confirmation of that belief. Maybe you are right, but maybe disease or weather are stronger contributors. Statistics gives us tools to test these ideas systematically. It helps us separate patterns from noise, avoid being misled by our own expectations, and draw conclusions that are more likely to hold up under scrutiny. It’s not magic, but it makes our conclusions far more reliable.\nAnother challenge is that data can tell very different stories depending on how they are aggregated. Simpson’s paradox occurs when a trend seen in combined data reverses after you split the data into meaningful groups.\nHere’s a recent example. During the COVID-19 pandemic, early data showed that Italy’s overall case fatality rate was higher than China’s. But, once researchers disaggregated by age group, the trend flipped: within every age group, the fatality rate was actually higher in China. The apparent contradiction was explained by differences in the age distribution of cases (von Kügelgen, Gresele, and Schölkopf 2021).\nUsing case fatality rate (CFR), here are some illustrative numbers (made up for teaching).\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 2 × 4\n#&gt;   Country Total_cases Total_deaths CFR_crude_pct\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1 China         43000         254          0.591\n#&gt; 2 Italy         11000         364.         3.31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Crude case fatality rates. Italy appears to have a higher fatality rate than China when all cases are combined.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt face value, Italy looks worse. But what happens when we stratify by age group? Because age strongly affects COVID fatality, splitting cases into 10-year bands reveals a different picture. When we do, China’s fatality rate is higher in every band.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Fatality rates by age group (same made-up numbers). Within each age band, China’s CFR exceeds Italy’s.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the reversal? Italy’s cases skew older while China’s skew younger, and baseline risk rises steeply with age. The differing age distributions weight the overall averages in opposite ways. Aggregating without age adjustment hid the within-group pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Case age distribution by country. Italy’s cases are older on average; China’s are younger.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics will not answer every scientific question, but it gives us a disciplined way to sort signal from bias so our inferences age well.",

    "text": "1.2 Statistics in Environmental Science: Why All the Numbers?\nYou may wonder why your environmental science class is suddenly filled with graphs, equations, and statistical terms. Why does environmental science have so much statistics? Let me break it down for you!\nWhy Does Environmental Science Need Statistics?\nIt’s a bit of a complex story, but let’s face it: nature is complex too! Unlike physics, where you might be studying straightforward things like electrons, in environmental science, we’re dealing with living ecosystems, unpredictable weather, and human behavior.\nThink of nature as a giant puzzle with pieces constantly changing shape. We use statistics to piece it together. We’re not dealing with simple objects; we’re dealing with the flow of rivers, the growth of forests, and the migration of animals. It’s a whole different ballgame.\nIn a sense, environmental scientists have to be part detective, part mathematician. We need to understand statistics because we’re solving harder problems than some other fields. We’re trying to make sense of the messy, beautiful, and intricate web of life.\nCan’t Someone Else Handle the Statistics?\nSure, you could ask someone else to do the math, but here’s the catch: understanding statistics is crucial for understanding environmental problems and solutions.\n\nThe Design Connection: Want to research how pollution affects fish? You’ll need to understand the statistics behind your study. Statistics and research design are like two sides of the same coin.\nUnderstanding the Science: Want to read up on climate change? You’ll find a lot of statistics in those papers. To truly get what’s going on, you need to know what those numbers are saying.\nThe Money Matter: Hiring a statistician for every project? That’ll cost you. Being self-sufficient in statistics means you can tackle more projects with fewer resources.\n\nBut What if I Don’t Care About Jobs, Research, or Conservation? Why Do I Need Statistics?\nWell, first of all, you’ve got me curious! But even if you’re just an everyday citizen, statistics matter. You’re surrounded by data, whether it’s weather forecasts, pollution reports, or wildlife trends.\nKnowing a bit about statistics is like having a decoder ring for the modern world. It helps you understand the news, make informed decisions, and even argue a point more convincingly.\nSo yes, statistics might feel like a strange guest in your environmental science class. But trust me, it’s a guest you want to get to know. Because understanding statistics isn’t just about crunching numbers; it’s about understanding our world and how we can make it better.",

    "text": "1.3 Statistics in everyday life\n\n“We are drowning in information,\nbut we are starved for knowledge”\n\n– Various authors, original probably John Naisbitt\n\nWhen I started writing up my lecture notes I took the 20 most recent news articles posted to the ABC news website. Of those 20 articles, it turned out that 8 of them involved a discussion of something that I would call a statistical topic; 6 of those made a mistake. The most common error, if you’re curious, was failing to report baseline data (e.g., the article mentions that 5% of people in situation X have some characteristic Y, but doesn’t say how common the characteristic is for everyone else!) The point I’m trying to make here isn’t that journalists are bad at statistics (though they almost always are), it’s that a basic knowledge of statistics is very helpful for trying to figure out when someone else is either making a mistake or even lying to you. Perhaps, one of the biggest things that a knowledge of statistics does to you is cause you to get angry at the newspaper or the internet on a far more frequent basis :).",

    "text": "1.4 There’s more to research methods than statistics\nSo far, most of what I’ve talked about is statistics, and so you’d be forgiven for thinking that statistics is all I care about in life. To be fair, you wouldn’t be far wrong, but research methodology is a broader concept than statistics. So most research methods courses will cover a lot of topics that relate much more to the pragmatics of research design, and in particular the issues that you encounter when trying to do research with humans. However, about 99% of student fears relate to the statistics part of the course, so I’ve focused on the stats in this discussion, and hopefully I’ve convinced you that statistics matters, and more importantly, that it’s not to be feared. That being said, it’s pretty typical for introductory research methods classes to be very stats-heavy. This is not (usually) because the lecturers are evil people. Quite the contrary, in fact. Introductory classes focus a lot on the statistics because you almost always find yourself needing statistics before you need the other research methods training. Why? Because almost all of your assignments in other classes will rely on statistical training, to a much greater extent than they rely on other methodological tools. It’s not common for undergraduate assignments to require you to design your own study from the ground up (in which case you would need to know a lot about research design), but it is common for assignments to ask you to analyse and interpret data that were collected in a study that someone else designed (in which case you need statistics). In that sense, from the perspective of allowing you to do well in all your other classes, the statistics is more urgent.\nBut note that “urgent” is different from “important” – they both matter. I really do want to stress that research design is just as important as data analysis, and this book does spend a fair amount of time on it. However, while statistics has a kind of universality, and provides a set of core tools that are useful for most types of psychological research, the research methods side isn’t quite so universal. There are some general principles that everyone should think about, but a lot of research design is very idiosyncratic, and is specific to the area of research that you want to engage in. To the extent that it’s the details that matter, those details don’t usually show up in an introductory stats and research methods class.",

It won’t give you enough information to allow you to design studies of your own, but it will give you a lot of the basic tools that you need to assess the studies done by other people. However, since the focus of this book is much more on data analysis than on data collection, I’m only giving a very brief overview. Note that this chapter is “special” in two ways. Firstly, it’s much more psychology-specific than the later chapters. Secondly, it focuses much more heavily on the scientific problem of research methodology, and much less on the statistical problem of data analysis. Nevertheless, the two problems are related to one another, so it’s traditional for stats textbooks to discuss the problem in a little detail. This chapter relies heavily on Campbell and Stanley (1963) for the discussion of study design, and Stevens (1946) for the discussion of scales of measurement.

    "section": "1.6 Introduction to measurements",
    "text": "1.6 Introduction to measurements\nThe first thing to understand is data collection can be thought of as a kind of measurement. That is, what we’re trying to do here is measure something about human behavior or the human mind. What do I mean by “measurement”?\n\n1.6.1 Some thoughts about measurements\nMeasurement itself is a subtle concept, but basically it comes down to finding some way of assigning numbers, or labels, or some other kind of well-defined descriptions to “stuff”. So, any of the following would count as a measurement:\n\nMy age is 33 years.\nI do not like anchovies.\nMy chromosomal gender is male.\nMy self-identified gender is male.\n\nIn the short list above, the bolded part is “the thing to be measured”, and the italicized part is “the measurement itself”. In fact, we can expand on this a little bit, by thinking about the set of possible measurements that could have arisen in each case:\n\nMy age (in years) could have been 0, 1, 2, 3 …, etc. The upper bound on what my age could possibly be is a bit fuzzy, but in practice you’d be safe in saying that the largest possible age is 150, since no human has ever lived that long.\nWhen asked if I like anchovies, I might have said that I do, or I do not, or I have no opinion, or I sometimes do.\nMy chromosomal gender is almost certainly going to be male (XY) or female (XX), but there are a few other possibilities. I could also have Klinfelter’s syndrome (XXY), which is more similar to male than to female. And I imagine there are other possibilities too.\nMy self-identified gender is also likely to be male or female, but it doesn’t have to agree with my chromosomal gender. I may also choose to identify with neither, or to explicitly call myself transgender.\n\nAs you can see, for some things (like age) it seems fairly obvious what the set of possible measurements should be, whereas for other things it gets a bit tricky. But I want to point out that even in the case of someone’s age, it’s much more subtle than this. For instance, in the example above, I assumed that it was okay to measure age in years. But if you’re a developmental psychologist, that’s way too crude, and so you often measure age in years and months (if a child is 2 years and 11 months, this is usually written as “2;11”). If you’re interested in newborns, you might want to measure age in days since birth, maybe even hours since birth. In other words, the way in which you specify the allowable measurement values is important.\nLooking at this a bit more closely, you might also realize that the concept of “age” isn’t actually all that precise. In general, when we say “age” we implicitly mean “the length of time since birth”. But that’s not always the right way to do it. Suppose you’re interested in how newborn babies control their eye movements. If you’re interested in kids that young, you might also start to worry that “birth” is not the only meaningful point in time to care about. If Baby Alice is born 3 weeks premature and Baby Bianca is born 1 week late, would it really make sense to say that they are the “same age” if we encountered them “2 hours after birth”? In one sense, yes: by social convention, we use birth as our reference point for talking about age in everyday life, since it defines the amount of time the person has been operating as an independent entity in the world, but from a scientific perspective that’s not the only thing we care about. When we think about the biology of human beings, it’s often useful to think of ourselves as organisms that have been growing and maturing since conception, and from that perspective Alice and Bianca aren’t the same age at all. So you might want to define the concept of “age” in two different ways: the length of time since conception, and the length of time since birth. When dealing with adults, it won’t make much difference, but when dealing with newborns it might.\nMoving beyond these issues, there’s the question of methodology. What specific “measurement method” are you going to use to find out someone’s age? As before, there are lots of different possibilities:\n\nYou could just ask people “how old are you?” The method of self-report is fast, cheap and easy, but it only works with people old enough to understand the question, and some people lie about their age.\nYou could ask an authority (e.g., a parent) “how old is your child?” This method is fast, and when dealing with kids it’s not all that hard since the parent is almost always around. It doesn’t work as well if you want to know “age since conception”, since a lot of parents can’t say for sure when conception took place. For that, you might need a different authority (e.g., an obstetrician).\nYou could look up official records, like birth certificates. This is time consuming and annoying, but it has its uses (e.g., if the person is now dead).\n\n\n\n1.6.2 Operationalization: defining your measurement\nAll of the ideas discussed in the previous section all relate to the concept of operationalization. To be a bit more precise about the idea, operationalization is the process by which we take a meaningful but somewhat vague concept, and turn it into a precise measurement. The process of operationalization can involve several different things:\n\nBeing precise about what you are trying to measure: For instance, does “age” mean “time since birth” or “time since conception” in the context of your research?\nDetermining what method you will use to measure it: Will you use self-report to measure age, ask a parent, or look up an official record? If you’re using self-report, how will you phrase the question?\nDefining the set of the allowable values that the measurement can take: Note that these values don’t always have to be numerical, though they often are. When measuring age, the values are numerical, but we still need to think carefully about what numbers are allowed. Do we want age in years, years and months, days, hours? Etc. For other types of measurements (e.g., gender), the values aren’t numerical. But, just as before, we need to think about what values are allowed. If we’re asking people to self-report their gender, what options to we allow them to choose between? Is it enough to allow only “male” or “female”? Do you need an “other” option? Or should we not give people any specific options, and let them answer in their own words? And if you open up the set of possible values to include all verbal response, how will you interpret their answers?\n\nOperationalization is a tricky business, and there’s no “one, true way” to do it. The way in which you choose to operationalize the informal concept of “age” or “gender” into a formal measurement depends on what you need to use the measurement for. Often you’ll find that the community of scientists who work in your area have some fairly well-established ideas for how to go about it. In other words, operationalization needs to be thought through on a case by case basis. Nevertheless, while there a lot of issues that are specific to each individual research project, there are some aspects to it that are pretty general.\nBefore moving on, I want to take a moment to clear up our terminology, and in the process introduce one more term. Here are four different things that are closely related to each other:\n\nA theoretical construct. This is the thing that you’re trying to take a measurement of, like “age”, “gender” or an “opinion”. A theoretical construct can’t be directly observed, and often they’re actually a bit vague.\nA measure. The measure refers to the method or the tool that you use to make your observations. A question in a survey, a behavioral observation or a brain scan could all count as a measure.\nAn operationalization. The term “operationalization” refers to the logical connection between the measure and the theoretical construct, or to the process by which we try to derive a measure from a theoretical construct.\nA variable. Finally, a new term. A variable is what we end up with when we apply our measure to something in the world. That is, variables are the actual “data” that we end up with in our data sets.\n\nIn practice, even scientists tend to blur the distinction between these things, but it’s very helpful to try to understand the differences.",

    "section": "1.7 Scales of measurement",
    "text": "1.7 Scales of measurement\nAs the previous section indicates, the outcome of a psychological measurement is called a variable. But not all variables are of the same qualitative type, and it’s very useful to understand what types there are. A very useful concept for distinguishing between different types of variables is what’s known as scales of measurement.\n\n1.7.1 Nominal scale\nA nominal scale variable (also referred to as a categorical variable) is one in which there is no particular relationship between the different possibilities: for these kinds of variables it doesn’t make any sense to say that one of them is ``bigger’ or “better” than any other one, and it absolutely doesn’t make any sense to average them. The classic example for this is “eye color”. Eyes can be blue, green and brown, among other possibilities, but none of them is any “better” than any other one. As a result, it would feel really weird to talk about an “average eye color”. Similarly, gender is nominal too: male isn’t better or worse than female, neither does it make sense to try to talk about an “average gender”. In short, nominal scale variables are those for which the only thing you can say about the different possibilities is that they are different. That’s it.\nLet’s take a slightly closer look at this. Suppose I was doing research on how people commute to and from work. One variable I would have to measure would be what kind of transportation people use to get to work. This “transport type” variable could have quite a few possible values, including: “train”, “bus”, “car”, “bicycle”, etc. For now, let’s suppose that these four are the only possibilities, and suppose that when I ask 100 people how they got to work today, and I get this:\n\n\n\nTransportation\nNumber of people\n\n\n\n\n(1) Train\n12\n\n\n(2) Bus\n30\n\n\n(3) Car\n48\n\n\n(4) Bicycle\n10\n\n\n\nSo, what’s the average transportation type? Obviously, the answer here is that there isn’t one. It’s a silly question to ask. You can say that travel by car is the most popular method, and travel by train is the least popular method, but that’s about all. Similarly, notice that the order in which I list the options isn’t very interesting. I could have chosen to display the data like this and nothing really changes.\n\n\n\nTransportation\nNumber of people\n\n\n\n\n(3) Car\n48\n\n\n(1) Train\n12\n\n\n(4) Bicycle\n10\n\n\n(2) Bus\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.2 Ordinal scale\nOrdinal scale variables have a bit more structure than nominal scale variables, but not by a lot. An ordinal scale variable is one in which there is a natural, meaningful way to order the different possibilities, but you can’t do anything else. The usual example given of an ordinal variable is “finishing position in a race”. You can say that the person who finished first was faster than the person who finished second, but you don’t know how much faster. As a consequence we know that 1st \\(&gt;\\) 2nd, and we know that 2nd \\(&gt;\\) 3rd, but the difference between 1st and 2nd might be much larger than the difference between 2nd and 3rd.\nHere’s an more psychologically interesting example. Suppose I’m interested in people’s attitudes to climate change, and I ask them to pick one of these four statements that most closely matches their beliefs:\n\n\nTemperatures are rising, because of human activity\n\nTemperatures are rising, but we don’t know why\n\nTemperatures are rising, but not because of humans\n\nTemperatures are not rising\n\n\nNotice that these four statements actually do have a natural ordering, in terms of “the extent to which they agree with the current science”. Statement 1 is a close match, statement 2 is a reasonable match, statement 3 isn’t a very good match, and statement 4 is in strong opposition to the science. So, in terms of the thing I’m interested in (the extent to which people endorse the science), I can order the items as \\(1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4\\). Since this ordering exists, it would be very weird to list the options like this…\n\n\nTemperatures are rising, but not because of humans\n\nTemperatures are rising, because of human activity\n\nTemperatures are not rising\n\nTemperatures are rising, but we don’t know why\n\n\n…because it seems to violate the natural “structure” to the question.\nSo, let’s suppose I asked 100 people these questions, and got the following answers:\n\n\n\n\nNumber\n\n\n\n\n(1) Temperatures are rising, because of human activity\n51\n\n\n(2) Temperatures are rising, but we don’t know why\n20\n\n\n(3) Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans\n10\n\n\n(4) Temperatures are not rising\n19\n\n\n\nWhen analyzing these data, it seems quite reasonable to try to group (1), (2) and (3) together, and say that 81 of 100 people were willing to at least partially endorse the science. And it’s also quite reasonable to group (2), (3) and (4) together and say that 49 of 100 people registered at least some disagreement with the dominant scientific view. However, it would be entirely bizarre to try to group (1), (2) and (4) together and say that 90 of 100 people said…what? There’s nothing sensible that allows you to group those responses together at all.\nThat said, notice that while we can use the natural ordering of these items to construct sensible groupings, what we can’t do is average them. For instance, in my simple example here, the “average” response to the question is 1.97. If you can tell me what that means, I’d love to know. Because that sounds like gibberish to me!\n\n\n1.7.3 Interval scale\nIn contrast to nominal and ordinal scale variables, interval scale and ratio scale variables are variables for which the numerical value is genuinely meaningful. In the case of interval scale variables, the differences between the numbers are interpretable, but the variable doesn’t have a “natural” zero value. A good example of an interval scale variable is measuring temperature in degrees Celsius. For instance, if it was 15\\(^\\circ\\) yesterday and 18\\(^\\circ\\) today, then the 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference between the two is genuinely meaningful. Moreover, that 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference is exactly the same as the 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference between \\(7^\\circ\\) and \\(10^\\circ\\). In short, addition and subtraction are meaningful for interval scale variables.\nHowever, notice that the \\(0^\\circ\\) does not mean “no temperature at all”: it actually means “the temperature at which water freezes”, which is pretty arbitrary. As a consequence, it becomes pointless to try to multiply and divide temperatures. It is wrong to say that \\(20^\\circ\\) is twice as hot as \\(10^\\circ\\), just as it is weird and meaningless to try to claim that \\(20^\\circ\\) is negative two times as hot as \\(-10^\\circ\\).\nAgain, lets look at a more psychological example. Suppose I’m interested in looking at how the attitudes of first-year university students have changed over time. Obviously, I’m going to want to record the year in which each student started. This is an interval scale variable. A student who started in 2003 did arrive 5 years before a student who started in 2008. However, it would be completely insane for me to divide 2008 by 2003 and say that the second student started “1.0024 times later” than the first one. That doesn’t make any sense at all.\n\n\n1.7.4 Ratio scale\nThe fourth and final type of variable to consider is a ratio scale variable, in which zero really means zero, and it’s okay to multiply and divide. A good psychological example of a ratio scale variable is response time (RT). In a lot of tasks it’s very common to record the amount of time somebody takes to solve a problem or answer a question, because it’s an indicator of how difficult the task is. Suppose that Alan takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, whereas Ben takes 3.1 seconds. As with an interval scale variable, addition and subtraction are both meaningful here. Ben really did take \\(3.1 - 2.3 = 0.8\\) seconds longer than Alan did. However, notice that multiplication and division also make sense here too: Ben took \\(3.1 / 2.3 = 1.35\\) times as long as Alan did to answer the question. And the reason why you can do this is that, for a ratio scale variable such as RT, “zero seconds” really does mean “no time at all”.\n\n\n1.7.5 Continuous versus discrete variables\nThere’s a second kind of distinction that you need to be aware of, regarding what types of variables you can run into. This is the distinction between continuous variables and discrete variables. The difference between these is as follows:\n\nA continuous variable is one in which, for any two values that you can think of, it’s always logically possible to have another value in between.\nA discrete variable is, in effect, a variable that isn’t continuous. For a discrete variable, it’s sometimes the case that there’s nothing in the middle.\n\nThese definitions probably seem a bit abstract, but they’re pretty simple once you see some examples. For instance, response time is continuous. If Alan takes 3.1 seconds and Ben takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, then it’s possible for Cameron’s response time to lie in between, by taking 3.0 seconds. And of course it would also be possible for David to take 3.031 seconds to respond, meaning that his RT would lie in between Cameron’s and Alan’s. And while in practice it might be impossible to measure RT that precisely, it’s certainly possible in principle. Because we can always find a new value for RT in between any two other ones, we say that RT is continuous.\nDiscrete variables occur when this rule is violated. For example, nominal scale variables are always discrete: there isn’t a type of transportation that falls “in between” trains and bicycles, not in the strict mathematical way that 2.3 falls in between 2 and 3. So transportation type is discrete. Similarly, ordinal scale variables are always discrete: although “2nd place” does fall between “1st place” and “3rd place”, there’s nothing that can logically fall in between “1st place” and “2nd place”. Interval scale and ratio scale variables can go either way. As we saw above, response time (a ratio scale variable) is continuous. Temperature in degrees Celsius (an interval scale variable) is also continuous. However, the year you went to school (an interval scale variable) is discrete. There’s no year in between 2002 and 2003. The number of questions you get right on a true-or-false test (a ratio scale variable) is also discrete: since a true-or-false question doesn’t allow you to be “partially correct”, there’s nothing in between 5/10 and 6/10. The table summarizes the relationship between the scales of measurement and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. I’m trying to hammer this point home, because (a) some textbooks get this wrong, and (b) people very often say things like “discrete variable” when they mean “nominal scale variable”. It’s very unfortunate.\n\nThe relationship between the scales of measurement and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with an x correspond to things that are possible.\n\n\n\ncontinuous\ndiscrete\n\n\n\n\nnominal\n\nx\n\n\nordinal\n\nx\n\n\ninterval\nx\nx\n\n\nratio\nx\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.6 Some complexities\nOkay, I know you’re going to be shocked to hear this, but …the real world is much messier than this little classification scheme suggests. Very few variables in real life actually fall into these nice neat categories, so you need to be kind of careful not to treat the scales of measurement as if they were hard and fast rules. It doesn’t work like that: they’re guidelines, intended to help you think about the situations in which you should treat different variables differently. Nothing more.\nSo let’s take a classic example, maybe the classic example, of a psychological measurement tool: the Likert scale. The humble Likert scale is the bread and butter tool of all survey design. You yourself have filled out hundreds, maybe thousands of them, and odds are you’ve even used one yourself. Suppose we have a survey question that looks like this:\n\nWhich of the following best describes your opinion of the statement that “all pirates are freaking awesome” …\n\nand then the options presented to the participant are these:\n\n(1) Strongly disagree\n(2) Disagree\n(3) Neither agree nor disagree\n(4) Agree\n(5) Strongly agree\n\nThis set of items is an example of a 5-point Likert scale: people are asked to choose among one of several (in this case 5) clearly ordered possibilities, generally with a verbal descriptor given in each case. However, it’s not necessary that all items be explicitly described. This is a perfectly good example of a 5-point Likert scale too:\n\n(1) Strongly disagree\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5) Strongly agree\n\nLikert scales are very handy, if somewhat limited, tools. The question is, what kind of variable are they? They’re obviously discrete, since you can’t give a response of 2.5. They’re obviously not nominal scale, since the items are ordered; and they’re not ratio scale either, since there’s no natural zero.\nBut are they ordinal scale or interval scale? One argument says that we can’t really prove that the difference between “strongly agree” and “agree” is of the same size as the difference between “agree” and “neither agree nor disagree”. In fact, in everyday life it’s pretty obvious that they’re not the same at all. So this suggests that we ought to treat Likert scales as ordinal variables. On the other hand, in practice most participants do seem to take the whole “on a scale from 1 to 5” part fairly seriously, and they tend to act as if the differences between the five response options were fairly similar to one another. As a consequence, a lot of researchers treat Likert scale data as if it were interval scale. It’s not interval scale, but in practice it’s close enough that we usually think of it as being quasi-interval scale.",

    "text": "1.8 Assessing the reliability of a measurement\nAt this point we’ve thought a little bit about how to operationalize a theoretical construct and thereby create a psychological measure; and we’ve seen that by applying psychological measures we end up with variables, which can come in many different types. At this point, we should start discussing the obvious question: is the measurement any good? We’ll do this in terms of two related ideas: reliability and validity. Put simply, the reliability of a measure tells you how precisely you are measuring something, whereas the validity of a measure tells you how accurate the measure is.\nReliability is actually a very simple concept: it refers to the repeatability or consistency of your measurement. The measurement of my weight by means of a “bathroom scale” is very reliable: if I step on and off the scales over and over again, it’ll keep giving me the same answer. Measuring my intelligence by means of “asking my mom” is very unreliable: some days she tells me I’m a bit thick, and other days she tells me I’m a complete moron. Notice that this concept of reliability is different to the question of whether the measurements are correct (the correctness of a measurement relates to it’s validity). If I’m holding a sack of potatoes when I step on and off of the bathroom scales, the measurement will still be reliable: it will always give me the same answer. However, this highly reliable answer doesn’t match up to my true weight at all, therefore it’s wrong. In technical terms, this is a reliable but invalid measurement. Similarly, while my mom’s estimate of my intelligence is a bit unreliable, she might be right. Maybe I’m just not too bright, and so while her estimate of my intelligence fluctuates pretty wildly from day to day, it’s basically right. So that would be an unreliable but valid measure. Of course, to some extent, notice that if my mum’s estimates are too unreliable, it’s going to be very hard to figure out which one of her many claims about my intelligence is actually the right one. To some extent, then, a very unreliable measure tends to end up being invalid for practical purposes; so much so that many people would say that reliability is necessary (but not sufficient) to ensure validity.\nOkay, now that we’re clear on the distinction between reliability and validity, let’s have a think about the different ways in which we might measure reliability:\n\nTest-retest reliability. This relates to consistency over time: if we repeat the measurement at a later date, do we get a the same answer?\nInter-rater reliability. This relates to consistency across people: if someone else repeats the measurement (e.g., someone else rates my intelligence) will they produce the same answer?\nParallel forms reliability. This relates to consistency across theoretically-equivalent measurements: if I use a different set of bathroom scales to measure my weight, does it give the same answer?\nInternal consistency reliability. If a measurement is constructed from lots of different parts that perform similar functions (e.g., a personality questionnaire result is added up across several questions) do the individual parts tend to give similar answers.\n\nNot all measurements need to possess all forms of reliability. For instance, educational assessment can be thought of as a form of measurement. One of the subjects that I teach, Inroduction to Environmental Science, has an assessment structure that has a presentation component and an exam component (plus other things). The exam component is intended to measure something different from the presentation component, so the assessment as a whole has low internal consistency. However, within the exam there are several questions that are intended to (approximately) measure the same things, and those tend to produce similar outcomes; so the exam on its own has a fairly high internal consistency. Which is as it should be. You should only demand reliability in those situations where you want to be measure the same thing!",

    "text": "1.9 The role of variables: predictors and outcomes\nOkay, I’ve got one last piece of terminology that I need to explain to you before moving away from variables. Normally, when we do some research we end up with lots of different variables. Then, when we analyse our data we usually try to explain some of the variables in terms of some of the other variables. It’s important to keep the two roles “thing doing the explaining” and “thing being explained” distinct. So let’s be clear about this now. Firstly, we might as well get used to the idea of using mathematical symbols to describe variables, since it’s going to happen over and over again. Let’s denote the “to be explained” variable \\(Y\\), and denote the variables “doing the explaining” as \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), etc.\nNow, when we doing an analysis, we have different names for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), since they play different roles in the analysis. The classical names for these roles are independent variable (IV) and dependent variable (DV). The IV is the variable that you use to do the explaining (i.e., \\(X\\)) and the DV is the variable being explained (i.e., \\(Y\\)). The logic behind these names goes like this: if there really is a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) then we can say that \\(Y\\) depends on \\(X\\), and if we have designed our study “properly” then \\(X\\) isn’t dependent on anything else. However, I personally find those names horrible: they’re hard to remember and they’re highly misleading, because (a) the IV is never actually “independent of everything else” and (b) if there’s no relationship, then the DV doesn’t actually depend on the IV. And in fact, because I’m not the only person who thinks that IV and DV are just awful names, there are a number of alternatives that I find more appealing.\nFor example, in an experiment the IV refers to the manipulation, and the DV refers to the measurement. So, we could use manipulated variable (independent variable) and measured variable (dependent variable).\n\nThe terminology used to distinguish between different roles that a variable can play when analyzing a data set.\n\n\nrole of the variable\nclassical name\nmodern name\n\n\n\n\n“to be explained”\ndependent variable (DV)\nMeasurement\n\n\n“to do the explaining”\nindependent variable (IV)\nManipulation\n\n\n\nWe could also use predictors and outcomes. The idea here is that what you’re trying to do is use \\(X\\) (the predictors) to make guesses about \\(Y\\) (the outcomes). This is summarized in the table:\n\nThe terminology used to distinguish between different roles that a variable can play when analyzing a data set.\n\n\nrole of the variable\nclassical name\nmodern name\n\n\n\n\n“to be explained”\ndependent variable (DV)\noutcome\n\n\n“to do the explaining”\nindependent variable (IV)\npredictor",

    "section": "1.10 Experimental and non-experimental research",
    "text": "1.10 Experimental and non-experimental research\nOne of the big distinctions that you should be aware of is the distinction between “experimental research” and “non-experimental research”. When we make this distinction, what we’re really talking about is the degree of control that the researcher exercises over the people and events in the study.\n\n1.10.1 Experimental research\nThe key features of experimental research is that the researcher controls all aspects of the study, especially what participants experience during the study. In particular, the researcher manipulates or varies something (IVs), and then allows the outcome variable (DV) to vary naturally. The idea here is to deliberately vary the something in the world (IVs) to see if it has any causal effects on the outcomes. Moreover, in order to ensure that there’s no chance that something other than the manipulated variable is causing the outcomes, everything else is kept constant or is in some other way “balanced” to ensure that they have no effect on the results. In practice, it’s almost impossible to think of everything else that might have an influence on the outcome of an experiment, much less keep it constant. The standard solution to this is randomization: that is, we randomly assign people to different groups, and then give each group a different treatment (i.e., assign them different values of the predictor variables). We’ll talk more about randomization later in this course, but for now, it’s enough to say that what randomization does is minimize (but not eliminate) the chances that there are any systematic difference between groups.\nLet’s consider a very simple, completely unrealistic and grossly unethical example. Suppose you wanted to find out if smoking causes lung cancer. One way to do this would be to find people who smoke and people who don’t smoke, and look to see if smokers have a higher rate of lung cancer. This is not a proper experiment, since the researcher doesn’t have a lot of control over who is and isn’t a smoker. And this really matters: for instance, it might be that people who choose to smoke cigarettes also tend to have poor diets, or maybe they tend to work in asbestos mines, or whatever. The point here is that the groups (smokers and non-smokers) actually differ on lots of things, not just smoking. So it might be that the higher incidence of lung cancer among smokers is caused by something else, not by smoking per se. In technical terms, these other things (e.g. diet) are called “confounds”, and we’ll talk about those in just a moment.\nIn the meantime, let’s now consider what a proper experiment might look like. Recall that our concern was that smokers and non-smokers might differ in lots of ways. The solution, as long as you have no ethics, is to control who smokes and who doesn’t. Specifically, if we randomly divide participants into two groups, and force half of them to become smokers, then it’s very unlikely that the groups will differ in any respect other than the fact that half of them smoke. That way, if our smoking group gets cancer at a higher rate than the non-smoking group, then we can feel pretty confident that (a) smoking does cause cancer and (b) we’re murderers.\n\n\n1.10.2 Non-experimental research\nNon-experimental research in environmental science often encompasses studies in which researchers cannot exert full control over variables as they might in a typical experimental setup. In environmental science, this issue is particularly pronounced, as there is no “control planet” to allow for perfect experimental conditions. This unique challenge leads to a reliance on alternative approaches, such as time series analysis, to understand complex environmental phenomena.\nOne distinction worth making between two types of non-experimental research is the difference between quasi-experimental research and case studies. Much of the research in environmental science fits into a quasi-experimental design. Here, researchers might wish to study the effects of industrial pollution on a river system but cannot directly control all the variables, such as the quantity or type of pollutants being emitted by various industries. Instead, they must observe existing conditions and make careful comparisons, possibly using statistical tools to account for confounding variables.\nTime series analysis becomes vital in this context, as many environmental processes unfold over extended periods. For example, tracking changes in global temperatures or sea level requires years of consistent data collection. The complexity and variability inherent in environmental systems make drawing definitive conclusions difficult, but sophisticated statistical methods can help isolate specific effects.\nEnvironmental science also frequently relies on detailed case studies. These investigations focus on particular events or locations to provide in-depth insights into environmental processes and their impacts on ecosystems, human health, and societal structures. Case studies might explore the aftermath of a natural disaster, the unique ecology of a threatened habitat, or the social and economic consequences of environmental policies.\nThough they often lack the broad generalizability of more controlled experimental research, case studies in environmental science offer valuable opportunities to understand the complexity of real-world situations. They can uncover nuances and subtleties that might be overlooked in a broader experimental or quasi-experimental approach.\nThe absence of a control planet and the complexity of environmental systems necessitates flexible and often non-traditional approaches to scientific inquiry in environmental science. While these methods, including quasi-experimental designs and case studies, may not offer the same level of control as experimental designs, they are indispensable tools in the field. By leveraging time series data, employing careful statistical analysis, and embracing the rich insights offered by focused case studies, researchers can continue to expand our understanding of the biosphere and its interactions with human activities.",

    "section": "1.11 Assessing the validity of a study",
    "text": "1.11 Assessing the validity of a study\nMore than any other thing, a scientist wants their research to be “valid”. The conceptual idea behind validity is very simple: can you trust the results of your study? If not, the study is invalid. However, while it’s easy to state, in practice it’s much harder to check validity than it is to check reliability. And in all honesty, there’s no precise, clearly agreed upon notion of what validity actually is. In fact, there’s lots of different kinds of validity, each of which raises it’s own issues, and not all forms of validity are relevant to all studies. I’m going to talk about five different types:\n\nInternal validity\nExternal validity\nConstruct validity\nFace validity\nEcological validity\n\nTo give you a quick guide as to what matters here…(1) Internal and external validity are the most important, since they tie directly to the fundamental question of whether your study really works. (2) Construct validity asks whether you’re measuring what you think you are. (3) Face validity isn’t terribly important except insofar as you care about “appearances”. (4) Ecological validity is a special case of face validity that corresponds to a kind of appearance that you might care about a lot.\n\n1.11.1 Internal validity\nInternal validity refers to the extent to which you are able draw the correct conclusions about the causal relationships between variables. It’s called “internal” because it refers to the relationships between things “inside” the study. Let’s illustrate the concept with a simple example. Suppose you’re interested in finding out whether a university education makes you write better. To do so, you get a group of first year students, ask them to write a 1000 word essay, and count the number of spelling and grammatical errors they make. Then you find some third-year students, who obviously have had more of a university education than the first-years, and repeat the exercise. And let’s suppose it turns out that the third-year students produce fewer errors. And so you conclude that a university education improves writing skills. Right? Except… the big problem that you have with this experiment is that the third-year students are older, and they’ve had more experience with writing things. So it’s hard to know for sure what the causal relationship is: Do older people write better? Or people who have had more writing experience? Or people who have had more education? Which of the above is the true cause of the superior performance of the third-years? Age? Experience? Education? You can’t tell. This is an example of a failure of internal validity, because your study doesn’t properly tease apart the causal relationships between the different variables.\n\n\n1.11.2 External validity\nExternal validity relates to the generalizability of your findings. That is, to what extent do you expect to see the same pattern of results in “real life” as you saw in your study. To put it a bit more precisely, any study that you do in psychology will involve a fairly specific set of questions or tasks, will occur in a specific environment, and will involve participants that are drawn from a particular subgroup. So, if it turns out that the results don’t actually generalize to people and situations beyond the ones that you studied, then what you’ve got is a lack of external validity.\nThe classic example of this issue is the fact that a very large proportion of studies in psychology will use undergraduate psychology students as the participants. Obviously, however, the researchers don’t care only about psychology students; they care about people in general. Given that, a study that uses only psych students as participants always carries a risk of lacking external validity. That is, if there’s something “special” about psychology students that makes them different to the general populace in some relevant respect, then we may start worrying about a lack of external validity.\nThat said, it is absolutely critical to realize that a study that uses only psychology students does not necessarily have a problem with external validity. I’ll talk about this again later, but it’s such a common mistake that I’m going to mention it here. The external validity is threatened by the choice of population if (a) the population from which you sample your participants is very narrow (e.g., psych students), and (b) the narrow population that you sampled from is systematically different from the general population, in some respect that is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that you intend to study. The italicized part is the bit that lots of people forget: it is true that psychology undergraduates differ from the general population in lots of ways, and so a study that uses only psych students may have problems with external validity. However, if those differences aren’t very relevant to the phenomenon that you’re studying, then there’s nothing to worry about. To make this a bit more concrete, here’s two extreme examples:\n\nYou want to measure “attitudes of the general public towards psychotherapy”, but all of your participants are psychology students. This study would almost certainly have a problem with external validity.\nYou want to measure the effectiveness of a visual illusion, and your participants are all psychology students. This study is very unlikely to have a problem with external validity\n\nHaving just spent the last couple of paragraphs focusing on the choice of participants (since that’s the big issue that everyone tends to worry most about), it’s worth remembering that external validity is a broader concept. The following are also examples of things that might pose a threat to external validity, depending on what kind of study you’re doing:\n\nPeople might answer a “psychology questionnaire” in a manner that doesn’t reflect what they would do in real life.\nYour lab experiment on (say) “human learning” has a different structure to the learning problems people face in real life.\n\n\n\n1.11.3 Construct validity\nConstruct validity is basically a question of whether you’re measuring what you want to be measuring. A measurement has good construct validity if it is actually measuring the correct theoretical construct, and bad construct validity if it doesn’t. To give very simple (if ridiculous) example, suppose I’m trying to investigate the rates with which university students cheat on their exams. And the way I attempt to measure it is by asking the cheating students to stand up in the lecture theater so that I can count them. When I do this with a class of 300 students, 0 people claim to be cheaters. So I therefore conclude that the proportion of cheaters in my class is 0%. Clearly this is a bit ridiculous. But the point here is not that this is a very deep methodological example, but rather to explain what construct validity is. The problem with my measure is that while I’m trying to measure “the proportion of people who cheat” what I’m actually measuring is “the proportion of people stupid enough to own up to cheating, or bloody minded enough to pretend that they do”. Obviously, these aren’t the same thing! So my study has gone wrong, because my measurement has very poor construct validity.\n\n\n1.11.4 Face validity\nFace validity simply refers to whether or not a measure “looks like” it’s doing what it’s supposed to, nothing more. If I design a test of intelligence, and people look at it and they say “no, that test doesn’t measure intelligence”, then the measure lacks face validity. It’s as simple as that. Obviously, face validity isn’t very important from a pure scientific perspective. After all, what we care about is whether or not the measure actually does what it’s supposed to do, not whether it looks like it does what it’s supposed to do. As a consequence, we generally don’t care very much about face validity. That said, the concept of face validity serves three useful pragmatic purposes:\n\nSometimes, an experienced scientist will have a “hunch” that a particular measure won’t work. While these sorts of hunches have no strict evidentiary value, it’s often worth paying attention to them. Because often times people have knowledge that they can’t quite verbalize, so there might be something to worry about even if you can’t quite say why. In other words, when someone you trust criticizes the face validity of your study, it’s worth taking the time to think more carefully about your design to see if you can think of reasons why it might go awry. Mind you, if you don’t find any reason for concern, then you should probably not worry: after all, face validity really doesn’t matter much.\nOften (very often), completely uninformed people will also have a “hunch” that your research is crap. And they’ll criticize it on the internet or something. On close inspection, you’ll often notice that these criticisms are actually focused entirely on how the study “looks”, but not on anything deeper. The concept of face validity is useful for gently explaining to people that they need to substantiate their arguments further.\nExpanding on the last point, if the beliefs of untrained people are critical (e.g., this is often the case for applied research where you actually want to convince policy makers of something or other) then you have to care about face validity. Simply because – whether you like it or not – a lot of people will use face validity as a proxy for real validity. If you want the government to change a law on scientific, psychological grounds, then it won’t matter how good your studies “really” are. If they lack face validity, you’ll find that politicians ignore you. Of course, it’s somewhat unfair that policy often depends more on appearance than fact, but that’s how things go.\n\n\n\n1.11.5 Ecological validity\nEcological validity is a different notion of validity, which is similar to external validity, but less important. The idea is that, in order to be ecologically valid, the entire set up of the study should closely approximate the real world scenario that is being investigated. In a sense, ecological validity is a kind of face validity – it relates mostly to whether the study “looks” right, but with a bit more rigor to it. To be ecologically valid, the study has to look right in a fairly specific way. The idea behind it is the intuition that a study that is ecologically valid is more likely to be externally valid. It’s no guarantee, of course. But the nice thing about ecological validity is that it’s much easier to check whether a study is ecologically valid than it is to check whether a study is externally valid. An simple example would be eyewitness identification studies. Most of these studies tend to be done in a university setting, often with fairly simple array of faces to look at rather than a line up. The length of time between seeing the “criminal” and being asked to identify the suspect in the “line up” is usually shorter. The “crime” isn’t real, so there’s no chance that the witness being scared, and there’s no police officers present, so there’s not as much chance of feeling pressured. These things all mean that the study definitely lacks ecological validity. They might (but might not) mean that it also lacks external validity.",

    "section": "1.12 Confounds, artifacts and other threats to validity",
    "text": "1.12 Confounds, artifacts and other threats to validity\nIf we look at the issue of validity in the most general fashion, the two biggest worries that we have are confounds and artifact. These two terms are defined in the following way:\n\nConfound: A confound is an additional, often unmeasured variable that turns out to be related to both the predictors and the outcomes. The existence of confounds threatens the internal validity of the study because you can’t tell whether the predictor causes the outcome, or if the confounding variable causes it, etc.\nArtifact: A result is said to be “artifactual” if it only holds in the special situation that you happened to test in your study. The possibility that your result is an artifact describes a threat to your external validity, because it raises the possibility that you can’t generalize your results to the actual population that you care about.\n\nAs a general rule confounds are a bigger concern for non-experimental studies, precisely because they’re not proper experiments: by definition, you’re leaving lots of things uncontrolled, so there’s a lot of scope for confounds working their way into your study. Experimental research tends to be much less vulnerable to confounds: the more control you have over what happens during the study, the more you can prevent confounds from appearing.\nHowever, there’s always swings and roundabouts, and when we start thinking about artifacts rather than confounds, the shoe is very firmly on the other foot. For the most part, artifactual results tend to be a concern for experimental studies than for non-experimental studies. To see this, it helps to realize that the reason that a lot of studies are non-experimental is precisely because what the researcher is trying to do is examine human behavior in a more naturalistic context. By working in a more real-world context, you lose experimental control (making yourself vulnerable to confounds) but because you tend to be studying human psychology “in the wild” you reduce the chances of getting an artifactual result. Or, to put it another way, when you take psychology out of the wild and bring it into the lab (which we usually have to do to gain our experimental control), you always run the risk of accidentally studying something different than you wanted to study: which is more or less the definition of an artifact.\nBe warned though: the above is a rough guide only. It’s absolutely possible to have confounds in an experiment, and to get artifactual results with non-experimental studies. This can happen for all sorts of reasons, not least of which is researcher error. In practice, it’s really hard to think everything through ahead of time, and even very good researchers make mistakes. But other times it’s unavoidable, simply because the researcher has ethics (e.g., see “differential attrition”).\nOkay. There’s a sense in which almost any threat to validity can be characterized as a confound or an artifact: they’re pretty vague concepts. So let’s have a look at some of the most common examples…\n\n1.12.1 History effects\nHistory effects refer to the possibility that specific events may occur during the study itself that might influence the outcomes. For instance, something might happen in between a pre-test and a post-test. Or, in between testing participant 23 and participant 24. Alternatively, it might be that you’re looking at an older study, which was perfectly valid for its time, but the world has changed enough since then that the conclusions are no longer trustworthy. Examples of things that would count as history effects:\n\nYou’re interested in how people think about risk and uncertainty. You started your data collection in December 2010. But finding participants and collecting data takes time, so you’re still finding new people in February 2011. Unfortunately for you (and even more unfortunately for others), the Queensland floods occurred in January 2011, causing billions of dollars of damage and killing many people. Not surprisingly, the people tested in February 2011 express quite different beliefs about handling risk than the people tested in December 2010. Which (if any) of these reflects the “true” beliefs of participants? I think the answer is probably both: the Queensland floods genuinely changed the beliefs of the Australian public, though possibly only temporarily. The key thing here is that the “history” of the people tested in February is quite different to people tested in December.\nYou’re testing the psychological effects of a new anti-anxiety drug. So what you do is measure anxiety before administering the drug (e.g., by self-report, and taking physiological measures, let’s say), then you administer the drug, and then you take the same measures afterwards. In the middle, however, because your labs are in Los Angeles, there’s an earthquake, which increases the anxiety of the participants.\n\n\n\n1.12.2 Maturation effects\nAs with history effects, maturational effects are fundamentally about change over time. However, maturation effects aren’t in response to specific events. Rather, they relate to how people change on their own over time: we get older, we get tired, we get bored, etc. Some examples of maturation effects:\n\nWhen doing developmental psychology research, you need to be aware that children grow up quite rapidly. So, suppose that you want to find out whether some educational trick helps with vocabulary size among 3 year olds. One thing that you need to be aware of is that the vocabulary size of children that age is growing at an incredible rate (multiple words per day), all on its own. If you design your study without taking this maturational effect into account, then you won’t be able to tell if your educational trick works.\nWhen running a very long experiment in the lab (say, something that goes for 3 hours), it’s very likely that people will begin to get bored and tired, and that this maturational effect will cause performance to decline, regardless of anything else going on in the experiment\n\n\n\n1.12.3 Repeated testing effects\nAn important type of history effect is the effect of repeated testing. Suppose I want to take two measurements of some psychological construct (e.g., anxiety). One thing I might be worried about is if the first measurement has an effect on the second measurement. In other words, this is a history effect in which the “event” that influences the second measurement is the first measurement itself! This is not at all uncommon. Examples of this include:\n\nLearning and practice: e.g., “intelligence” at time 2 might appear to go up relative to time 1 because participants learned the general rules of how to solve “intelligence-test-style” questions during the first testing session.\nFamiliarity with the testing situation: e.g., if people are nervous at time 1, this might make performance go down; after sitting through the first testing situation, they might calm down a lot precisely because they’ve seen what the testing looks like.\nAuxiliary changes caused by testing: e.g., if a questionnaire assessing mood is boring, then mood at measurement at time 2 is more likely to become “bored”, precisely because of the boring measurement made at time 1.\n\n\n\n1.12.4 Selection bias\nSelection bias is a pretty broad term. Suppose that you’re running an experiment with two groups of participants, where each group gets a different “treatment”, and you want to see if the different treatments lead to different outcomes. However, suppose that, despite your best efforts, you’ve ended up with a gender imbalance across groups (say, group A has 80% females and group B has 50% females). It might sound like this could never happen, but trust me, it can. This is an example of a selection bias, in which the people “selected into” the two groups have different characteristics. If any of those characteristics turns out to be relevant (say, your treatment works better on females than males) then you’re in a lot of trouble.\n\n\n1.12.5 Differential attrition\nwithin the study itself, impacting both the internal and external validity of the research. This phenomenon can occur in environmental studies, where participants’ commitment to certain practices might change over time, such as in multi-year studies on cover cropping.\nWhen thinking about the effects of differential attrition, it is sometimes helpful to distinguish between two different types. The first is homogeneous attrition, in which the attrition effect is the same for all groups, treatments or conditions. Homogeneous attrition occurs when the dropout rate is roughly the same across different groups or conditions within the study. For instance, if many farmers participating in a cover cropping study discontinue the practice at similar rates, the sample may become unrepresentative. Though the internal validity (accuracy of the study’s conclusions) might remain intact, the external validity (generalizability to the broader population) may suffer. In the realm of environmental science, this could mean the study’s findings are less applicable to the broader community of farmers or agricultural systems.\nThe second type of differential attrition is heterogeneous attrition, in which the attrition effect is different for different groups. This is a much bigger problem: not only do you have to worry about your external validity, you also have to worry about your internal validity too. In a study on cover cropping, if certain groups, perhaps motivated by specific incentives or pressures, drop out at different rates, this can introduce a confounding variable. The comparison between the remaining participants may no longer be valid, as the groups have become fundamentally different due to the non-random dropout. This not only affects the generalizability of the findings but also the internal validity, as the study’s conclusions within the sample itself may be compromised.\n\n\n1.12.6 Non-response bias\nNon-response bias is closely related to selection bias, and to differential attrition. The simplest version of the problem goes like this. You mail out a survey to 1000 people, and only 300 of them reply. The 300 people who replied are almost certainly not a random sub-sample. People who respond to surveys are systematically different to people who don’t. This introduces a problem when trying to generalize from those 300 people who replied, to the population at large; since you now have a very non-random sample. The issue of non-response bias is more general than this, though. Among the (say) 300 people that did respond to the survey, you might find that not everyone answers every question. If (say) 80 people chose not to answer one of your questions, does this introduce problems? As always, the answer is maybe. If the question that wasn’t answered was on the last page of the questionnaire, and those 80 surveys were returned with the last page missing, there’s a good chance that the missing data isn’t a big deal: probably the pages just fell off. However, if the question that 80 people didn’t answer was the most confrontational or invasive personal question in the questionnaire, then almost certainly you’ve got a problem. In essence, what you’re dealing with here is what’s called the problem of missing data. If the data that is missing was “lost” randomly, then it’s not a big problem. If it’s missing systematically, then it can be a big problem.\n\n\n1.12.7 Regression to the mean\nRegression to the mean is a curious variation on selection bias. It refers to any situation where you select data based on an extreme value on some measure. Because the measure has natural variation, it almost certainly means that when you take a subsequent measurement, that later measurement will be less extreme than the first one, purely by chance.\nHere’s an example. Suppose we are interested in examining the effects of specific climatic conditions on the growth of a particular plant species. We identify the 20 locations with the most significant growth during a year of favorable weather conditions, such as ideal rainfall and temperature, and decide to study these areas further.\nAfter another year, we observe that the plant growth in these 20 locations is still above average but not as exceptional as during the first year. The immediate reaction might be to conclude that a change in environmental practices or some other factor has adversely affected growth in these areas.\nHowever, this might simply be an example of regression to the mean. Consider what is required for remarkable plant growth: optimal soil, hard work in maintenance, favorable weather conditions, and perhaps a bit of luck with other uncontrollable environmental factors.\nWhile the soil quality and maintenance practices may be consistent from one year to the next, luck with weather is not. Certain areas that were fortunate with ideal weather conditions in the first year may not experience the same fortune in the following year. This inconsistency in luck leads to a less extreme measurement the second time.\nRegression to the mean is surprisingly common. For instance, if two very tall people have kids, their children will tend to be taller than average, but not as tall as the parents. The reverse happens with very short parents: two very short parents will tend to have short children, but nevertheless those kids will tend to be taller than the parents. It can also be extremely subtle. For instance, there have been studies done that suggested that people learn better from negative feedback than from positive feedback. However, the way that people tried to show this was to give people positive reinforcement whenever they did good, and negative reinforcement when they did bad. And what you see is that after the positive reinforcement, people tended to do worse; but after the negative reinforcement they tended to do better. But! Notice that there’s a selection bias here: when people do very well, you’re selecting for “high” values, and so you should expect (because of regression to the mean) that performance on the next trial should be worse, regardless of whether reinforcement is given. Similarly, after a bad trial, people will tend to improve all on their own. The apparent superiority of negative feedback is an artifact caused by regression to the mean (Kahneman and Tversky 1973)\n\n\n1.12.8 Experimenter bias\nExperimenter bias can occur when the researcher, despite conscientious efforts, inadvertently influences the results of a study. This may not involve communication with human participants as in other fields but could still manifest in several ways within environmental research.\nIn environmental science, the experimenter might have expectations or preconceived notions about what the data should reveal. For instance, a researcher studying the effects of a certain agricultural practice on soil health may unconsciously select or emphasize data that align with their expectations or theoretical commitments. This can lead to a bias in data collection or interpretation, subtly steering the results toward the expected outcome.\nExperimenter bias can also arise from methodological choices. A researcher may design an experiment, select sites for observation, or choose measurement techniques in a way that favors a particular outcome. For example, if studying the effect of pollution on a water source, the researcher might unintentionally choose sampling times or locations that are more likely to confirm their hypotheses, overlooking variations that could provide a more comprehensive and unbiased view.\nIn some cases, the researcher’s bias may inadvertently influence other field or laboratory personnel involved in the study. A team member who understands the desired outcome of the study may unconsciously alter procedures, handling of samples, or recording of data to align with the researcher’s expectations.\nThe classic example of experimenter bias is the case study of “Clever Hans”, which dates back to 1907, (Pfungst 1911; Hothersall 2004). Clever Hans was a horse that apparently was able to read and count, and perform other human like feats of intelligence. After Clever Hans became famous, psychologists started examining his behavior more closely. It turned out that – not surprisingly – Hans didn’t know how to do maths. Rather, Hans was responding to the human observers around him. Because they did know how to count, and the horse had learned to change its behavior when people changed theirs.\nThe general solution to the problem of experimenter bias is to engage in double blind studies, where neither the experimenter nor the participant knows which condition the participant is in, or knows what the desired behavior is. This provides a very good solution to the problem, but it’s important to recognize that it’s not quite ideal, and typically not feasible in Environmental Science. Measures to mitigate this bias include rigorous peer review, careful documentation of methods, and maintaining an awareness of potential biases.\n\n\n1.12.9 Reactivity and Demand Effects\nEven in environmental studies, the knowledge that a process or phenomenon is being observed can impact the behavior of the researchers or those involved in data collection. The basic idea is captured by the Hawthorne effect: people alter their performance because of the attention that the study focuses on them. The effect takes its name from a the “Hawthorne Works” factory outside of Chicago (Adair 1984). A study done in the 1920s looking at the effects of lighting on worker productivity at the factory turned out to be an effect of the fact that the workers knew they were being studied, rather than the lighting. This so-called “Hawthorne effect” might influence how a field team conducts measurements if they know the specific goal of the study.\n\n\n1.12.10 Placebo effects\nWhile typically associated with clinical trials, the placebo effect can have an analogous impact in environmental research. For instance, a belief in the efficacy of a certain conservation practice might lead to subjective reporting or unintentional data manipulation.\n\n\n1.12.11 Situation, measurement and subpopulation effects\nIn some respects, these terms are a catch-all term for “all other threats to external validity”. The choice of location, time, measurement tools, and even who collects the data can all influence the results. Ensuring robust methodologies and considering the potential influences of these factors can help in achieving results that generalize more widely.\n\n\n1.12.12 Fraud, deception and self-deception\n\nIt is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.\n\n– Upton Sinclair\n\nOne final thing that I feel like I should mention. While reading what the textbooks often have to say about assessing the validity of the study, I couldn’t help but notice that they seem to make the assumption that the researcher is honest. I find this hilarious. While the vast majority of scientists are honest, in my experience at least, some are not. Not only that, as I mentioned earlier, scientists are not immune to belief bias – it’s easy for a researcher to end up deceiving themselves into believing the wrong thing, and this can lead them to conduct subtly flawed research, and then hide those flaws when they write it up. So you need to consider not only the (probably unlikely) possibility of outright fraud, but also the (probably quite common) possibility that the research is unintentionally “slanted”. I opened a few standard textbooks and didn’t find much of a discussion of this problem, so here’s my own attempt to list a few ways in which these issues can arise are:\n\nData fabrication. Sometimes, people just make up the data. This is occasionally done with “good” intentions. For instance, the researcher believes that the fabricated data do reflect the truth, and may actually reflect “slightly cleaned up” versions of actual data. On other occasions, the fraud is deliberate and malicious. Some high-profile examples where data fabrication has been alleged or shown include Cyril Burt (a psychologist who is thought to have fabricated some of his data), Andrew Wakefield (who has been accused of fabricating his data connecting the MMR vaccine to autism) and Hwang Woo-suk (who falsified a lot of his data on stem cell research).\nHoaxes. Hoaxes share a lot of similarities with data fabrication, but they differ in the intended purpose. A hoax is often a joke, and many of them are intended to be (eventually) discovered. Often, the point of a hoax is to discredit someone or some field. There’s quite a few well known scientific hoaxes that have occurred over the years (e.g., Piltdown man) some of were deliberate attempts to discredit particular fields of research (e.g., the Sokal affair).\nData misrepresentation. While fraud gets most of the headlines, it’s much more common in my experience to see data being misrepresented. When I say this, I’m not referring to newspapers getting it wrong (which they do, almost always). I’m referring to the fact that often, the data don’t actually say what the researchers think they say. My guess is that, almost always, this isn’t the result of deliberate dishonesty, it’s due to a lack of sophistication in the data analyses. For instance, think back to the example of Simpson’s paradox that I discussed in the beginning of these notes. It’s very common to see people present “aggregated” data of some kind; and sometimes, when you dig deeper and find the raw data yourself, you find that the aggregated data tell a different story to the disaggregated data. Alternatively, you might find that some aspect of the data is being hidden, because it tells an inconvenient story (e.g., the researcher might choose not to refer to a particular variable). There’s a lot of variants on this; many of which are very hard to detect.\nStudy “misdesign”. Okay, this one is subtle. Basically, the issue here is that a researcher designs a study that has built-in flaws, and those flaws are never reported in the paper. The data that are reported are completely real, and are correctly analysed, but they are produced by a study that is actually quite wrongly put together. The researcher really wants to find a particular effect, and so the study is set up in such a way as to make it “easy” to (artifactually) observe that effect. One sneaky way to do this – in case you’re feeling like dabbling in a bit of fraud yourself – is to design an experiment in which it’s obvious to the participants what they’re “supposed” to be doing, and then let reactivity work its magic for you. If you want, you can add all the trappings of double blind experimentation etc. It won’t make a difference, since the study materials themselves are subtly telling people what you want them to do. When you write up the results, the fraud won’t be obvious to the reader: what’s obvious to the participant when they’re in the experimental context isn’t always obvious to the person reading the paper. Of course, the way I’ve described this makes it sound like it’s always fraud: probably there are cases where this is done deliberately, but in my experience the bigger concern has been with unintentional misdesign. The researcher believes …and so the study just happens to end up with a built in flaw, and that flaw then magically erases itself when the study is written up for publication.\nData mining & post hoc hypothesizing. Another way in which the authors of a study can more or less lie about what they found is by engaging in what’s referred to as “data mining”. As we’ll discuss later in the class, if you keep trying to analyse your data in lots of different ways, you’ll eventually find something that “looks” like a real effect but isn’t. This is referred to as “data mining”. It used to be quite rare because data analysis used to take weeks, but now that everyone has very powerful statistical software on their computers, it’s becoming very common. Data mining per se isn’t “wrong”, but the more that you do it, the bigger the risk you’re taking. The thing that is wrong, and I suspect is very common, is unacknowledged data mining. That is, the researcher run every possible analysis known to humanity, finds the one that works, and then pretends that this was the only analysis that they ever conducted. Worse yet, they often “invent” a hypothesis after looking at the data, to cover up the data mining. To be clear: it’s not wrong to change your beliefs after looking at the data, and to reanalyze your data using your new “post hoc” hypotheses. What is wrong (and, I suspect, common) is failing to acknowledge that you’ve done so. If you acknowledge that you did it, then other researchers are able to take your behavior into account. If you don’t, then they can’t. And that makes your behavior deceptive. Bad!\nPublication bias & self-censoring. Finally, a pervasive bias is “non-reporting” of negative results. This is almost impossible to prevent. Journals don’t publish every article that is submitted to them: they prefer to publish articles that find “something”. So, if 20 people run an experiment looking at whether reading Finnegans Wake causes insanity in humans, and 19 of them find that it doesn’t, which one do you think is going to get published? Obviously, it’s the one study that did find that Finnegans Wake causes insanity. This is an example of a publication bias: since no-one ever published the 19 studies that didn’t find an effect, a naive reader would never know that they existed. Worse yet, most researchers “internalize” this bias, and end up self-censoring their research. Knowing that negative results aren’t going to be accepted for publication, they never even try to report them. As a friend of mine says “for every experiment that you get published, you also have 10 failures”. And she’s right. The catch is, while some (maybe most) of those studies are failures for boring reasons (e.g. you stuffed something up) others might be genuine “null” results that you ought to acknowledge when you write up the “good” experiment. And telling which is which is often hard to do. A good place to start is a paper by Ioannidis (2005) with the depressing title “Why most published research findings are false”. I’d also suggest taking a look at work by Kühberger, Fritz, and Scherndl (2014) presenting statistical evidence that this actually happens in psychology.\n\nThere’s probably a lot more issues like this to think about, but that’ll do to start with. What I really want to point out is the blindingly obvious truth that real world science is conducted by actual humans, and only the most gullible of people automatically assumes that everyone else is honest and impartial. Actual scientists aren’t usually that naive, but for some reason the world likes to pretend that we are, and the textbooks we usually write seem to reinforce that stereotype.",

You’re already familiar with the idea of having more than one independent variable (IV) in your experiments. These IVs can be structured in various ways: all between-subjects, all within-subjects (like repeated measures), or a mix of both. ANOVA is our trusty tool to analyze these designs, giving us insights into each IV’s main effect and their interactions.\nFactorial designs are very common in environmental research. You’ll often come across studies showing results from these designs. It’s crucial to be comfortable interpreting these results. The key skill here is to recognize patterns of main effects and interactions in data graphs. This can get tricky with more than two IVs, each having multiple levels.",

    "text": "11.1.1 2x2 designs\nLet’s explore 2x2 designs. Here, you can expect two main effects and one interaction. You’ll compare means for each main effect and interaction. There are eight possible outcomes in such a design:\n\nno IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, no interaction\nIV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, no interaction\nIV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, interaction\nIV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, no interaction\nIV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, interaction\nno IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, no interaction\nno IV1 main effect, IV2 main effect, interaction\nno IV1 main effect, no IV2 main effect, interaction\n\nOK, so if you run a 2x2, any of these 8 general patterns could occur in your data. That’s a lot to keep track of isn’t it? As you develop your skills in examining graphs that plot means, you should be able to look at the graph and visually guesstimate if there is, or is not, a main effect or interaction. You will need you inferential statistics to tell you for sure, but it is worth knowing how to know see the patterns.\nLet’s visualize these outcomes using R. We’ll create bar and line graphs to illustrate these patterns. Bar graphs are great for seeing differences in means directly, while line graphs help us spot interactions – look for crossing lines as a hint of interaction. Figure 11.1 shows the possible patterns of main effects and interactions in bar graph form. Here is a legend for the labels in the panels.\n\n1 = there was a main effect for IV1.\n~1 = there was not a main effect for IV1\n2 = there was a main effect for IV2\n~2 = there was not a main effect of IV2\n1x2 = there was an interaction\n~1x2 = there was not an interaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: 8 Example patterns for means for each of the possible kinds of general outcomes in a 2x2 design.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2 shows the same eight patterns in line graph form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Line graphs showing 8 possible general outcomes for a 2x2 design.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn line graphs, interactions are more apparent. Parallel lines suggest no interaction, while crossing lines indicate potential interactions. The position of points relative to each other helps identify main effects. Things get complicated fast. When designing experiments, aim for the minimum number of independent variables (IVs) and levels needed to answer your research question. This approach makes interpreting your data more straightforward and your conclusions clearer. Whenever you see that someone ran a 4x3x7x2 design, your head should spin. It’s just too complicated.",

    "section": "11.2 Interpreting main effects and interactions",
    "text": "11.2 Interpreting main effects and interactions\nUnderstanding main effects and interactions is essential for accurately interpreting research data, especially in complex fields like environmental science.\nA main effect refers to the consistent impact of an independent variable (IV) on a dependent variable (DV). For example, in environmental studies, consider the effect of a specific fertilizer (IV) on plant growth (DV). If using this fertilizer consistently results in increased growth compared to not using it, we observe a clear main effect. This effect remains true regardless of other variables such as soil type or weather conditions.\nOften, it is convenient to think of main effects as a consistent influence of one manipulation. However, the picture changes when we introduce an interaction. An interaction occurs when the effect of one IV depends on another IV. By definition, an interactino means that some main effect is not behaving consistently across different situations. For instance, the impact of our fertilizer might vary depending on the level of sunlight or the type of soil, indicating an interaction between these factors and the fertilizer. This interaction disrupts the consistency of the main effect, suggesting that the effect of the fertilizer is not uniform across all conditions.\nResearchers often phrase their findings to highlight this complexity: “We found a main effect of X, BUT, this main effect was qualified by an interaction between X and Y.” The use of “BUT” here is crucial. It signals that the main effect cannot be fully understood without considering the interaction. The interaction indicates that the influence of the IV changes under different conditions, making it essential to consider these variables together for a complete understanding.\nIn environmental science, this becomes particularly relevant when studying ecosystems or climate interactions, where multiple variables interplay in complex ways. The interpretation of main effects and interactions in such contexts is not just about identifying individual effects but understanding how these effects change in different environmental settings.\nHere are two generalized examples to help you make sense of these issues:\n\n11.2.1 A consistent main effect and an interaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: Example means showing a generally consistent main effect along with an interaction\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3 shows a main effect and interaction. There is a main effect of IV2: the level 1 means (red points and line) are both lower than the level 2 means (aqua points and line). There is also an interaction. The size of the difference between the red and aqua points in the A condition (left) is bigger than the size of the difference in the B condition.\nHow would we interpret this? We could say there WAS a main effect of IV2, BUT it was qualified by an IV1 x IV2 interaction.\nWhat’s the qualification? The size of the IV2 effect changed as a function of the levels of IV1. It was big for level A, and small for level B of IV1.\nWhat does the qualification mean for the main effect? Well, first it means the main effect can be changed by the other IV. That’s important to know. Does it also mean that the main effect is not a real main effect because there was an interaction? Not really, there is a generally consistent effect of IV2. The green points are above the red points in all cases. Whatever IV2 is doing, it seems to work in at least a couple situations, even if the other IV also causes some change to the influence.\n\n\n11.2.2 An inconsistent main effect and an interaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: Example data showing how an interaction exists, and a main effect does not, even though the means for the main effect may show a difference\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4 shows another 2x2 design. You should see an interaction here straight away. The difference between the aqua and red points in condition A (left two dots) is huge, and there is 0 difference between them in condition B. Is there an interaction? Yes!\nAre there any main effects here? With data like this, sometimes an ANOVA will suggest that you do have significant main effects. For example, what is the mean difference between level 1 and 2 of IV2? That is the average of the green points ( (10+5)/2 = 15/2= 7.5 ) compared to the average of the red points (5). There will be a difference of 2.5 for the main effect (7.5 vs. 5).\nStarting to see the issue here? From the perspective of the main effect (which collapses over everything and ignores the interaction), there is an overall effect of 2.5. In other words, level 2 adds 2.5 in general compared to level 1. However, we can see from the graph that IV2 does not do anything in general. It does not add 2.5s everywhere. It adds 5 in condition A, and nothing in condition B. It only does one thing in one condition.\nWhat is happening here is that a “main effect” is produced by the process of averaging over a clear interaction.\nHow would we interpret this? We might have to say there was a main effect of IV2, BUT we would definitely say it was qualified by an IV1 x IV2 interaction.\nWhat’s the qualification? The size of the IV2 effect completely changes as a function of the levels of IV1. It was big for level A, and nonexistent for level B of IV1.\nWhat does the qualification mean for the main effect? In this case, we might doubt whether there is a main effect of IV2 at all. It could turn out that IV2 does not have a general influence over the DV all of the time, it may only do something in very specific circumstances, in combination with the presence of other factors.",

    "text": "11.3 Mixed Designs\nIn this book, we’ve explored various research designs, emphasizing that they can take different forms. These designs can be categorized as either between-subjects, where different subjects are in each group, or within-subjects, where the same subjects participate in all conditions. When you combine these approaches in a single study, you create what’s known as a mixed design.\nA mixed design occurs when one of your independent variables (IVs) is treated as a between-subjects factor, while another is treated as a within-subjects factor. This blend offers a unique approach to examining how different variables interact and affect the outcome.\nIn environmental science research, mixed designs are particularly useful for studying complex interactions between variables that vary both within and between subjects. For instance, consider a study examining the impact of a new agricultural technique (IV1) on crop yield (DV). This technique could be applied to different plots of land (between-subjects factor), while also measuring the impact across different seasons (within-subjects factor). Such a design allows researchers to understand not only the overall effectiveness of the technique but also how its impact varies seasonally.\nThe key to successfully navigating mixed designs lies in understanding how to calculate the appropriate statistical measures. Specifically, the F-values for each effect in an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) are constructed using different error terms, depending on whether the IV is a within-subjects or between-subjects factor. While it’s possible to run an ANOVA with any combination of between and within-subjects IVs, the complexity increases with the number of variables and their categorizations.\nAs this is an introductory text, we won’t delve into the detailed formulas for constructing ANOVA tables with mixed designs. More advanced textbooks offer comprehensive discussions on this topic, and many resources are available online for those interested in deeper exploration.",

    "section": "11.4 More complicated designs",
    "text": "11.4 More complicated designs\nUp until now we have focused on the simplest case for factorial designs, the 2x2 design, with two IVs, each with 2 levels. It is worth spending some time looking at a few more complicated designs and how to interpret them.\n\n11.4.1 3x2 design\nIn a 3x2 design there are two IVs. IV1 has three levels, and IV2 has two levels. Typically, there would be one DV. Let’s apply this to an environmental science scenario.First, let’s make the design concrete.\nImagine a study examining the impact of different irrigation methods (IV1: drip irrigation vs. sprinkler irrigation) on crop yield (DV) across three types of soil (IV2: sandy, loamy, clayey). The main effects would be the overall impact of irrigation method and soil type on crop yield, while the interaction would explore how these effects vary together.\nFor instance, drip irrigation might consistently produce higher yields than sprinkler irrigation, showing a main effect of IV1. Soil type might also independently affect yield, with loamy soil perhaps leading to the highest yields, followed by clayey and sandy soils, indicating a main effect of IV2. An interaction would occur if, for example, the advantage of drip irrigation over sprinkler irrigation is more pronounced in sandy soil compared to clayey soil. Note that these examples are hypothetical to illustrate the concept.\nThe factorial ANOVA will test:\n\nwhether there are any differences in crop yield among the three levels of soil type\nwhether there are any differences in crop yield among the two levels of irrigation\nwhether there is any interaction between irrigation type and soil type\n\nYou have three null hypotheses:\n\nThere is no difference between the means for each level of soil type:\n\nH0: \\(\\mu_{Clay} = \\mu_{Loam} = \\mu_{Sand}\\)\n\n\nThere is no difference between the means for each level of irrigation:\n\nH0: \\(\\mu_{Drip} = \\mu_{Sprinkler}\\)\n\n\nThere is no interaction between the factors.\n\nRemember, this is far better than running two separate single factor ANOVAs that contrast irrigation effects for each level of soil type because you have more statistical power (higher degrees of freedom) for the tests of interest, and you get a formal test of the interaction between factors which is often scientifically interesting.\nWe might expect data like shown in Figure 11.5:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Example means for a 3x2 factorial design in environmental science\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure shows some pretend means in all conditions. Let’s talk about the main effects and interaction.\n\nMain Effect of Irrigation Method: The main effect of the irrigation method is evident. Drip irrigation (represented by red line) generally leads to higher crop yields compared to sprinkler irrigation (represented by aqua line).\nMain Effect of Soil Type: The main effect of soil type is clearly present. Clayey soils show the highest yield, followed by loamy soils, then sandy soils\nInteraction Between Irrigation Method and Soil Type: Is there an interaction? Yes, there is. Remember, an interaction occurs when the effect of one IV depends on the levels of an another. The advantage of drip irrigation over sprinkler irrigation is more pronounced in sandy soil compared to clayey soil. So, the size of the irrigation effect (drip vs. sprinkler) changes with the type of soil. There is evidence in the means for an interaction. You would have to conduct an inferential test on the interaction term to see if these differences were likely or unlikely to be due to sampling error.\n\nIf there was no interaction and no main effect of soil type, we would see something like the pattern in Figure 11.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: Example means for a 3x2 design in environmental science with only one main effect\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would you say about the interaction if you saw the pattern in Figure 11.7?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: Example means for a 3x2 design in environmental science showing a different interaction pattern\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correct answer is that there is evidence in the means for an interaction. Remember, we are measuring the irrigation effect (effect of drip vs. sprinkler) three times. The irrigation effect is the same for clayey and loamy soils, but it is much smaller for sandy soils. The size of the irrigation effect depends on the levels of the soil type IV, so here again there is an interaction.\n\n\n11.4.2 2x2x2 designs\nLet’s take it up a notch and look at a 2x2x2 design. In a 2x2x2 design, there are three independent variables (IVs), each with two levels. This design allows for the examination of three main effects, three two-way interactions, and one three-way interaction.\nWe’ll add another independent variable to our example from before: crop type (wheat vs. corn) as our third IV. So overall, in this 2x2x2 design, we’ll consider three independent variables (IVs): irrigation method (IV1: drip vs. sprinkler), soil type (IV2: sandy vs. clayey), and crop type (IV3: wheat vs. corn). The dependent variable (DV) is still crop yield. This design helps us understand not just individual effects but also how these factors interact in various combinations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.8: Example means from a 2x2x2 design in environmental science with no three-way interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nn Figure 11.8, we have two panels: one for corn and one for wheat. You can think of the 2x2x2 as two 2x2 designs, one for each crop type. The key takeaway? Both wheat and corn show similar patterns, indicating a 2x2 interaction between irrigation method and soil type. We observe main effects for irrigation and soil type, but no main effect for crop type, and importantly, no three-way interaction.\nBut what exactly is a three-way interaction? It occurs when the pattern of a 2x2 interaction differs across the levels of the third variable. Let’s visualize this with Figure 11.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.9: Example means from a 2x2x2 design in environmental science with a three-way interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are looking at a 3-way interaction between irrigation type, crop type, and soil type. What is going on here?\nFor corn crop yields, we see that there is a smaller irrigation effect in clayey soils, but the effect of irrigation gets bigger in sandy soils. A pattern like this might make sense, sandy soils don’t retain much water so the irrigation method might matter more.\nThe wheat crop yields show a different pattern. Here, the irrigation effect is large in clayey soils and smaller in sandy soils. This difference in patterns between corn and wheat yields indicates a three-way interaction among irrigation type, soil type, and crop type.\nIn other words, the 2x2 interaction for the corn is different from the 2x2 interaction for the wheat. This can be conceptualized as an interaction between the two interactions, and as a result there is a three-way interaction, called a 2x2x2 interaction.\nA general pattern here. Imagine you had a 2x2x2x2 design. That would have a 4-way interaction. What would that mean? It would mean that the pattern of the 2x2x2 interaction changes across the levels of the 4th IV. If two three-way interactions are different, then there is a four-way interaction.This becomes very complicated very quickly, another reminder of why simplicity in design is desirable.\n\n\n11.4.3 Understanding and Interpreting Interactions in Environmental Science\nSo, you’ve got a handle on what interactions are and what they might look like. But there’s still a key question hanging in the air: Why do interactions matter?\n\n11.4.3.1 Interpreting the Results\nRemember our example exploring the impact of different irrigation methods on crop yield across various soil types? The data in Figure 11.5 revealed something interesting: drip irrigation significantly boosts crop yield in sandy soil, but this effect diminishes in loamy and clayey soils. This is what we call an interaction effect: the impact of the irrigation method (drip vs. sprinkler) on crop yield varies depending on the soil type.\nThis interaction is important. It tells us that the effectiveness of an irrigation method is not uniform across all soil types. It suggests that environmental factors (like soil type) can influence how well an intervention (like irrigation method) works.\n\n\n11.4.3.2 Practical Implications in Environmental Science\nUnderstanding these interactions has real-world implications for environmental management and policy-making. Consider these examples:\n\nResource Allocation: By understanding how different soil types interact with various irrigation methods, farmers can tailor their agricultural practices more precisely. For instance, in areas with clayey soil, which retains water well, less frequent irrigation might be more suitable, reducing water usage and preserving natural resources.\nClimate Adaptation Strategies: Understanding these interactions could play a role in developing climate adaptation strategies. For regions facing increased rainfall variability due to climate change, selecting the right combination of soil management and irrigation techniques can help in maintaining crop yields despite changing weather patterns.\nPolicy Formulation: Insights from these interactions can guide the creation of more nuanced agricultural policies. For example, providing subsidies or incentives for adopting certain irrigation methods in specific soil types could optimize crop yield and promote sustainability.\n\nThink about it: are there other environmental factors where understanding interactions could be crucial for effective management and policy-making?\n\n\n\n\nBarnes, Mallory L. 2023.

In classical ANOVA, we might report a common variance or standard deviation, or opt for group-specific measures (potentially through confidence intervals), ensuring to note that variances are not significantly different.

They can handle diverse data types and model relationships that aren’t strictly linear, making them crucial for studying environmental systems.\nSo far, in our exploration of parametric tests, we have primarily focused on two types of relationships:\n\nA categorical X and a continuous Y: This includes tests like the t-test and ANOVA.\nA continuous X and a continuous Y: This is typically analyzed using linear regression.\n\nGeneral Linear Models (GLMs) significantly expand our analytically capabilities. They are not limited to just these basic scenarios but offer a more versatile toolkit. GLMs are particularly adept at handling:\n\nMore Complex Relationships: They can model scenarios where relationships between variables are not strictly linear.\nDiverse Data Types: GLMs are suitable for various data types, including count data, which is often encountered in environmental studies.\n\n\n\n12.1.3 Understanding ANOVA as a linear model:\nANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, is traditionally viewed as a technique to compare means across multiple groups. However, at its core, ANOVA is a linear model. It’s a special case where the predictors are categorical, not continuous. This distinction is important but subtle. Let’s delve into an example that illustrates this concept clearly.\nThis example should be familiar from lecture. Imagine a researcher is exploring the effects of metal contamination on the species richness of sessile marine invertebrates. They’re particularly interested in the impact of copper and the orientation of the substrate on which these organisms live. To investigate this, they conduct a factorial experiment, measuring species richness across different levels of copper enrichment (None, Low, High) and substrate orientation (Vertical, Horizontal). This setup allows us to not only consider each factor separately but also examine their potential interaction.\nThe ANOVA framework provides three null hypotheses to test:\n\nThere are no differences in species richness across the copper levels.\nThere are no differences in species richness between substrate orientations.\nThere is no interaction effect between copper levels and substrate orientation.\n\nThese hypotheses can be represented in a linear model as follows:\n\\(y_{ijk} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{Copper_i} + \\beta_{Orientation_j} + \\beta_{Copper \\times Orientation_{ij}} + \\varepsilon_{ijk}\\)\nHere, \\(\\beta_0\\) is the grand mean (intercept), \\(\\beta_{Copper_i}\\) and \\(\\beta_{Orientation_j}\\) are the main effects of the copper levels and orientation, respectively, and \\(\\beta_{Copper \\times Orientation_{ij}}\\) represents the interaction between these factors. The \\(\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\) term captures the residual variance, or the random deviation of each observation from the model prediction. The significance of each beta coefficient is tested to determine if it makes a meaningful contribution to the model. A non-significant beta suggests that the corresponding factor or interaction does not have a distinct effect on the outcome, and therefore, might be omitted from the model for parsimony.\nWhen conducting an ANOVA, we’re essentially fitting a linear model with categorical predictors. These predictors are represented by beta coefficients in our model, which show the unique contribution of each factor (like copper levels or substrate orientation) to the outcome variable (such as species richness). The critical question we ask is whether each beta coefficient is significant—does it make a meaningful difference to our model?\nIn statistical terms, we assess this by examining the F-statistic. The F-statistic is a ratio that compares the amount of variance explained by a particular factor to the variance not explained by the model (within-group variance or error). A higher F-statistic indicates that the factor explains a significant portion of the variability in the outcome variable, while a lower F-statistic suggests that the factor does not contribute much to our understanding of the outcome variable.\n\\(F = \\frac{MS_{Treatment}}{MS_{Error}}\\).\nIn an ANOVA with two factors, we calculate the F-statistic for each factor and their interaction. We don’t need to show the actual calculation here—what matters is that the F-statistic tells us if the factor makes a significant contribution. If it does, we keep the beta coefficient in our model. If not, we may consider omitting it for a simpler model.\nIt turns out that ANOVAs are just a type of linear model in which the predictor variable is categorical. In practice, we can perform ANOVA using the lm() function in R, treating the categorical predictors as factors. This allows us to use the familiar beta notation and interpret ANOVA as a linear regression model with categorical predictors.",

Now, let’s merge these concepts to broaden our analytical horizon.

    "text": "12.3 Introducing the Indicator or Dummy Variable\nIn General Linear Models (GLMs), indicator or dummy variables allow us to include categorical variables in models traditionally designed for continuous variables.\n\n12.3.1 Understanding Indicator Variables\nIndicator variables are used to encode categories. For n categories, you need n-1 indicator variables.\nConsider a scenario with 5 species of wombat. We can code these species using 4 indicator variables:\n\n\n\nInd1\nInd2\nInd3\nInd4\nSpecies\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\nSpecies 1\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\nSpecies 2\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\nSpecies 3\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\nSpecies 4\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\nSpecies 5\n\n\n\nIn the simplest case of two categories, only one indicator variable is needed:\n\n0 = Wombat Species 1\n1 = Wombat Species 2\n\n\n12.3.1.1 Flipping the Switch: Indicator Variables in Action\nIn the context of GLMs, “turning on” an indicator variable means assigning it a value of 1. This action activates certain terms in the equation that are multiplied by the indicator variable, thereby altering the model’s output.\nWhen an indicator variable (xc) is set to 1, it effectively activates any terms in the equation that are multiplied by xc. This can change the slope and/or intercept of the regression line, depending on how xc is used in the equation.\nFor example, in the equation y = 2xl + 3 + 1xcxl - 7xc:\n\nWhen xc = 0 (turned off), the equation simplifies to y = 2xl + 3. Here, the terms 1xcxl and -7xc are deactivated because they are multiplied by xc, which is 0.\nWhen xc = 1 (turned on), the equation becomes y = (2xl + 3) + (1xl - 7). In this case, the terms 1xcxl and -7xc are activated, altering the slope and intercept of the line.\n\n\n\n12.3.1.2 Visualizing the Effect\nThe R plots below demonstrate the change in the regression line when the indicator variable is toggled between being active (xc = 1) and inactive (xc = 0).\nWhen xc = 0:\nEquation Simplified: y = 2xl + 3\nWhen xc = 1:\nEquation Modified: y = (2xl + 3) + (1xl - 7)\nThe plot on the left shows the regression line when the indicator variable is inactive. The equation simplifies, reflecting a scenario where the categorical variable does not influence the outcome.\nThe plot on the right illustrates the regression line when the indicator variable is active. The equation now includes additional terms, showcasing how the presence of the categorical variable changes the relationship between xl and y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing indicator variables, we can create models in which regression lines change completely depending on which category we’re modeling. If we need to tweak both the intercept and the slope, then we will need two new regression parameters – \\(\\beta_2\\) and \\(\\beta_3\\).\n\n\n\n12.3.2 Interaction Term in GLMs\nJust like in ANOVA, interaction terms in GLMs tell us whether one variable’s effect on the outcome changes when another variable comes into play.\n\nSimple Definition: In statistics, an interaction term helps us understand if the effect of one factor (like temperature) on an outcome (like plant growth) changes when another factor (like rainfall) is also considered. It’s like asking, “Does the relationship between temperature and plant growth change when we also consider how much it rains?”\n\n\n12.3.2.1 The Math Behind The Interactions\n\nModel Equation Explained:\n\nLet’s break down a typical equation:\n\\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_l + \\beta_2x_c + \\beta_3x_lx_c + \\epsilon\n\\]\nHere, \\(x_lx_c\\) is the interaction term, and \\(\\beta _3\\) is its coefficient.\n\n\\(y\\) is what we’re trying to predict (like plant growth).\n\\(\\beta_0\\) is the starting point of our prediction when all other factors are zero.\n\\(\\beta_1x_l\\) shows how our prediction changes with changes in a continuous variable (like temperature).\n\\(\\beta_2x_c\\) shows the change with a categorical variable (like type of plant).\n\\(\\beta_3x_lx_c\\) is the key player here. It shows how the effect of our continuous variable (temperature) changes across different categories (types of plants).\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term, accounting for variations we can’t explain with our model.\n\\(\\beta_1x_l\\) and \\(\\beta_2x_c\\) represent the main effects of the continuous and categorical variables, respectively.\n\n\n\n12.3.2.2 When is the Interaction Term Significant?\n\nSignificance of \\(\\beta_3x_lx_c\\) :\n\nIf \\(\\beta_3x_lx_c\\) (our interaction term) is significant, it means the relationship between our continuous variable (like temperature) and our outcome (plant growth) is different for different categories (like types of plants). If \\(\\beta_3x_lx_c\\) is not significant, it suggests that the effect of our continuous variable is consistent across categories, and we might not need this term in our model.\n\n\n12.3.2.3 What are the options for our model?\n\nFull Model with Interaction (\\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3\\)):\n\nWhen both the categorical (\\(x_c\\)) and continuous (\\(x_l\\)) variables are significant, and there is a significant interaction (\\(\\beta_3\\)), the model unfolds into two distinct linear equations for each category of\\(x_c\\). This indicates that the relationship between the continuous variable and the outcome differs depending on the category of the categorical variable.\nEquations:\n\nFor \\(x_c = 0\\): \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_l\\)\nFor \\(x_c = 1\\): \\(y = (\\beta_0 + \\beta_2) + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3)x_l\\)\n\n\n**Model without Interaction ((_0, _1, _2)):**\n\nIf both the categorical and continuous variables are significant, but there is no interaction, the model simplifies to parallel lines for each category of $x_c $,, indicating that the slope (effect of \\(x_l\\), is consistent across categories.\nEquations:\n\nFor \\(x_c = 0\\): \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_l\\)\nFor \\(x_c = 1\\): \\(y = (\\beta_0 + \\beta_2) + \\beta_1x_l\\)\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression (\\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1\\)):\n\nIf only the continuous variable (\\(x_l\\)) is significant, the model reduces to a simple linear regression, indicating a linear relationship between\\(x_l\\) and \\(y\\), regardless of the category of\\(x_c\\).\nEquation: \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_l\\)\n\nTwo Different Means (T-test Equivalent) (\\(\\beta_0, \\beta_2\\)):\n\nIf the continuous variable is not significant but the categorical variable is, the model effectively becomes a comparison of means between two groups (similar to a t-test).\nEquations:\n\nFor \\(x_c = 0\\): \\(y = \\beta_0\\)\nFor \\(x_c = 1\\): \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_2\\)\n\n\nSingle Mean (One Sample Data) (\\(\\beta_0\\)):\n\nIf neither variable is significant, the model reduces to a single mean, indicating no effect of either the continuous or categorical variable.\nEquation: \\(y = \\beta_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3.3 Terminology in GLMs\nUnderstanding the terminology used in General Linear Models (GLMs) is important for grasping the concepts and effectively communicating your findings. Here are some key terms:\n\nFixed Factor: This refers to a categorical variable with specific, predefined categories. For example, if you’re studying the effect of different seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter) on plant growth, ‘season’ is a fixed factor because it represents specific, distinct categories of interest.\nRandom Factor: This is a categorical variable where the categories represent a random sample from a larger population. For instance, if you’re examining the output quality from different machines in a factory, and these machines are randomly selected from a larger set, then ‘machine’ is a random factor.\nCovariate: This is your continuous variable that varies along with the dependent variable (Y). In environmental studies, this could be something like temperature, rainfall, or pollution levels, which you suspect might influence your outcome of interest (like species distribution or plant growth).",

    "text": "12.4 So, What Exactly is ANCOVA?\nAnalysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) is a statistical method that combines the principles of ANOVA and regression. It’s designed to compare categorical independent variables—such as different treatments or groups—while controlling for the influence of continuous variables. These continuous variables, known as covariates, are typically not the primary focus but could affect the outcome.\nFor ANCOVA, you need:\n\nA continuous dependent variable (the main effect you’re studying)\nAt least one continuous independent variable (covariate)\nAt least one categorical independent variable (which can be either a fixed or random factor)\n\n\n12.4.1 The Null Hypothesis in ANCOVA\nDemystifying the Concept: The null hypothesis in ANCOVA suggests that once we adjust for the covariates, the categorical independent variables do not significantly affect the dependent variable. Essentially, we’re testing whether the apparent differences between groups are genuine or just statistical noise.\nMathematically Speaking: In a simple ANCOVA model, the null hypothesis posits that the adjusted means for each level of the categorical variable are equivalent, once we account for the covariate:\n\\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\ldots = \\mu_t\\)\n\\(H_A: \\mu_i \\neq \\mu_j^* \\text{ for some } i \\neq j\\)\nThis translates to: “After controlling for the covariate, the different levels of the categorical independent variable do not lead to different outcomes.”\n\n\n12.4.2 Testing the Null Hypothesis\nConducting the Test: When we perform ANCOVA, we examine the null hypothesis through an omnibus F-test. If we find sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, we infer that significant differences exist among the adjusted means of the dependent variable across the categorical groups, even after considering the covariate.\nInterpreting the Findings: Rejecting the null hypothesis indicates that the categorical independent variable has a significant impact on the dependent variable, aside from the covariate’s effect. It’s crucial to remember, though, that statistical significance doesn’t automatically translate to practical significance. We must always consider the results within the specific context and aims of the study.",

    "text": "12.5 Illustrating ANCOVA with an Example\n\n12.5.1 Setting the Stage\nImagine we’re environmental scientists studying the impact of air pollution—a continuous variable—on bird species distribution, our dependent variable. We want to see if this relationship differs between urban and rural areas—our categorical variable. For this purpose, we’ve created a synthetic dataset to model the scenario.\n\n\n12.5.2 Crafting the Model\nWith our data in hand, we’d construct an ANCOVA model to discern whether location type influences bird distribution, beyond what can be explained by pollution levels alone. This would involve coding our categorical variable (urban vs. rural) into a dummy variable and including air pollution as a covariate in the model. I’ve done this for you already by creating the synthetic dataset.\n\nDataset Overview: Our dataset comprises 200 observations, capturing bird species density in various urban and rural locations, along with corresponding levels of air pollution.\n\n\n\n12.5.3 Why We’re Running the ANCOVA\n\nResearch Question: Does the effect of air pollution on bird species density differ between urban and rural areas?\nExpectation: We predict that air pollution will have a more pronounced negative effect on bird species density in urban areas than in rural areas.\n\n\n\n12.5.4 Null and Alternative Hypotheses in our example ANCOVA\n\nOmnibus Null Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): The null hypothesis posits that once we adjust for air pollution, the mean bird species density does not differ between urban and rural areas.\n\n\\(H_0: \\mu^*_{\\text{Urban}} = \\mu^*_{\\text{Rural}}\\)\n\\(H_A: \\mu^*_{\\text{Urban}} \\neq \\mu^*_{\\text{Rural}}\\)\nWhere \\(\\mu^*_{\\text{Urban}}\\) and \\(\\mu^*_{\\text{Rural}}\\) represent the adjusted means of bird species density for urban and rural areas, respectively..\n\nNull Hypothesis for Slope (\\(H_{01}\\)): This hypothesis examines if the effect of air pollution on bird species density is consistent between urban and rural areas.\n\n\\(H_{01}\\): There is no interaction between air pollution and area type; the slopes are parallel.\n\\(H_{A1}\\): There is an interaction; the effect of air pollution on bird species density differs between urban and rural areas.\n\n\n\\(H_{01}: \\beta_{\\text{interaction}} = 0\\)\n\\(H_{A1}: \\beta_{\\text{interaction}} \\neq 0\\)\n\nNull Hypothesis for Intercept (\\(H_{02}\\)): If we find no significant interaction, we then consider the intercepts. This hypothesis tests whether the baseline bird species density, at zero air pollution, differs between urban and rural areas.\n\n\\(H_{02}\\): The intercepts are the same, indicating no difference in bird species density between urban and rural areas at zero air pollution.\n\\(H_{A2}\\): The intercepts differ, suggesting an inherent difference in bird species density between urban and rural areas, independent of air pollution.\n\n\n\\(H_{02}: \\beta_{0\\text{,Urban}} = \\beta_{0\\text{,Rural}}\\)\n\\(H_{A2}: \\beta_{0\\text{,Urban}} \\neq \\beta_{0\\text{,Rural}}\\)\nRejecting \\(H_{02}\\) would imply that there is an inherent difference in bird species density due to area type, even before considering the air pollution levels.\nThese hypotheses guide our ANCOVA model and analysis, aiming to isolate the effects of urbanization from the influence of air pollution on avian populations.\n\n\n12.5.5 Analysis\n\n12.5.5.1 Explore the data\n\n#&gt;   AreaType AirPollution BirdDensity\n#&gt; 1    Urban        148.9          25\n#&gt; 2    Urban         39.7          39\n#&gt; 3    Urban         37.6          24\n#&gt; 4    Rural         58.8          30\n#&gt; 5    Urban         54.9          18\n#&gt; 6    Rural         38.2          35\n\nLet’s create a summary of our current dataset\n\nsummary(data)\n#&gt;    AreaType          AirPollution     BirdDensity   \n#&gt;  Length:200         Min.   : 25.80   Min.   : 6.00  \n#&gt;  Class :character   1st Qu.: 54.45   1st Qu.:18.00  \n#&gt;  Mode  :character   Median : 83.60   Median :25.00  \n#&gt;                     Mean   : 86.14   Mean   :24.83  \n#&gt;                     3rd Qu.:117.72   3rd Qu.:32.00  \n#&gt;                     Max.   :149.90   Max.   :43.00\n\nThis will give us a quick statistical summary of our variables.\nNow, let’s visualize the distribution of bird density in different areas.\n\n\n# Boxplot for bird density by area type\nboxplot(BirdDensity ~ AreaType, data = data, \n        main = \"Bird Density by Area Type\", \n        xlab = \"Area Type\", ylab = \"Bird Density\", \n        col = \"aquamarine\", border = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the same for air pollution:\n\nboxplot(AirPollution ~area_type, data=data, main=\"Air Pollution by Area\", xlab=\"Area Type\", ylab= \"Air Pollution\", col=\"aquamarine\", border=\"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.5.6 Results of the ANCOVA Model\nThe anova results\n\nancova &lt;- aov(BirdDensity ~ AirPollution*AreaType, data=data)\nsummary(ancova)\n#&gt;                        Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(&gt;F)    \n#&gt; AirPollution            1      6     5.9   0.086  0.7690    \n#&gt; AreaType                1   1688  1688.0  24.788 1.4e-06 ***\n#&gt; AirPollution:AreaType   1    291   291.3   4.277  0.0399 *  \n#&gt; Residuals             196  13347    68.1                    \n#&gt; ---\n#&gt; Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nThe linear model results\n\nancova_lm &lt;- lm(BirdDensity ~ AirPollution*AreaType, data=data)\nsummary(ancova_lm)\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Call:\n#&gt; lm(formula = BirdDensity ~ AirPollution * AreaType, data = data)\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Residuals:\n#&gt;      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n#&gt; -17.9260  -6.2694   0.4038   5.9023  19.2857 \n#&gt; \n#&gt; Coefficients:\n#&gt;                             Estimate Std.

However, the linear model’s marginal p-value (p = 0.081641) suggests a trend that might have been significant with a larger sample size or reduced variability.\nArea Type: There is a significant main effect of AreaType on bird density (p &lt; 0.001), indicating that there are considerable differences in bird density between rural and urban areas, with urban areas showing lower bird density.\n\n\n\n12.5.6.2 Interpreting the Beta Coefficients:\n\nIntercept: Reflecting the expected bird density in rural areas at zero air pollution, the intercept is quite high, indicating a relatively healthy bird population in the absence of pollution.\nArea Type: The beta coefficient for our area type factor is significantly different from zero (p &lt; 0.001), suggesting a distinct difference in bird density between urban and rural areas. However, this effect is captured more precisely in the interaction term.\nInteraction Term: The significant beta for the interaction term confirms our hypothesis that air pollution’s effect on bird density is not uniform across urban and rural areas.\n\n\n\n12.5.6.3 Visual Representation:\nThe scatter plot with regression lines will demonstrate these relationships visually, showing the differing trends for urban and rural areas suggested by the significant interaction term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.5.6.4 Interpretation:\nThe significant interaction term indicates that the simple main effect of air pollution is not adequate to describe its impact on bird density. In urban areas, there seems to be a slightly positive or less negative relationship compared to rural areas, which could reflect a range of urban-specific factors affecting bird populations differently than in rural areas.\n\n\n\n12.5.7 Contextualizing the Findings:\nThe lack of a significant main effect for air pollution in the presence of a significant interaction suggests complex underlying ecological dynamics. These findings call for nuanced environmental management strategies that address the specific challenges and conditions of urban and rural habitats to support bird conservation effectively. By considering the interaction term’s significance, we gain a more accurate understanding of the ecological effects of air pollution, which is essential for developing targeted conservation policies.",

We began by understanding the conceptual framework of ANOVA as a linear model, setting the stage for the more complex ANCOVA analysis. Through our discussions, we emphasized the importance of the null and alternative hypotheses in ANCOVA, using practical examples like the study of bird species density in different environments to illustrate these concepts. The chapter highlighted how ANCOVA adjusts for the effects of additional variables, allowing us to more accurately isolate and understand the impact of our factors of interest. By integrating real-world scenarios and focusing on clear, practical applications, we aimed to demystify the process of hypothesis testing in ANCOVA, making it accessible and relevant to environmental science.\n\n\n\n\nBarnes, Mallory L. 2023.

    "text": "13.1 Effect-size and power\nYou might be happy that this is the last chapter (so far) of this textbook. At this point we are in the last weeks of our introductory statistics course. It’s called “introductory” for a reason. There’s just too much out there to cover in one short semester. In this chapter we acknowledge some of the things we haven’t yet covered, and treat them as things that you should think about. If there is one take home message that we want to get across to you, it’s that when you ask questions with data, you should be able to justify how you answer those questions.\nIf you already know something about statistics while you were reading this book, you might have noticed that we neglected to discuss the topic of effect-size, and we barely talked about statistical power. We will talk a little bit about these things here.\nFirst, it is worth pointing out that over the years, at least in Psychology, many societies and journals have made recommendations about how researchers should report their statistical analyses. Among the recommendations is that measures of “effect size” should be reported. Similarly, many journals now require that researchers report an “a priori” power-analysis (the recommendation is this should be done before the data is collected). Because these recommendations are so prevalent, it is worth discussing what these ideas refer to. At the same time, the meaning of effect-size and power somewhat depend on your “philosophical” bent, and these two ideas can become completely meaningless depending on how you think of statistics. For these complicating reasons we have suspended our discussion of the topic until now.\nThe question or practice of using measures of effect size and conducting power-analyses are also good examples of the more general need to think about about what you are doing. If you are going to report effect size, and conduct power analyses, these activities should not be done blindly because someone else recommends that you do them, these activities and other suitable ones should be done as a part of justifying what you are doing. It is a part of thinking about how to make your data answer questions for you.",

    "text": "13.1.1 Chance vs. real effects\nLet’s rehash something we’ve said over and over again. First, researchers are interested in whether their manipulation causes a change in their measurement. If it does, they can become confident that they have uncovered a causal force (the manipulation). However, we know that differences in the measure between experimental conditions can arise by chance alone, just by sampling error. In fact, we can create pictures that show us the window of chance for a given statistic, these tells us roughly the range and likelihoods of getting various differences just by chance. With these windows in hand, we can then determine whether the differences we found in some data that we collected were likely or unlikely to be due to chance. We also learned that sample-size plays a big role in the shape of the chance window. Small samples give chance a large opportunity make big differences. Large samples give chance a small opportunity to make big differences. The general lesson up to this point has been, design an experiment with a large enough sample to detect the effect of interest. If your design isn’t well formed, you could easily be measuring noise, and your differences could be caused by sampling error. Generally speaking, this is still a very good lesson: better designs produce better data; and you can’t fix a broken design with statistics.\nThere is clearly another thing that can determine whether or not your differences are due to chance. That is the effect itself. If the manipulation does cause a change, then there is an effect, and that effect is a real one. Effects refer to differences in the measurement between experimental conditions. The thing about effects is that they can be big or small, they have a size.\nFor example, you can think of a manipulation in terms of the size of its hammer. A strong manipulation is like a jack-hammer: it is loud, it produces a big effect, it creates huge differences. A medium manipulation is like regular hammer: it works, you can hear it, it drives a nail into wood, but it doesn’t destroy concrete like a jack-hammer, it produces a reliable effect. A small manipulation is like tapping something with a pencil: it does something, you can barely hear it, and only in a quiet room, it doesn’t do a good job of driving a nail into wood, and it does nothing to concrete, it produces tiny, unreliable effects. Finally, a really small effect would be hammering something with a feather, it leaves almost no mark and does nothing that is obviously perceptiple to nails or pavement. The lesson is, if you want to break up concrete, use a jack-hammer; or, if you want to measure your effect, make your manipulation stronger (like a jack-hammer) so it produces a bigger difference.\n\n\n13.1.2 Effect size: concrete vs. abstract notions\nGenerally speaking, the big concept of effect size, is simply how big the differences are, that’s it. However, the biggness or smallness of effects quickly becomes a little bit complicated. On the one hand, the raw difference in the means can be very meaningful. Let’s saw we are measuring performance on a final exam, and we are testing whether or not a miracle drug can make you do better on the test. Let’s say taking the drug makes you do 5% better on the test, compared to not taking the drug. You know what 5% means, that’s basically a whole letter grade. Pretty good. An effect-size of 25% would be even better right! Lot’s of measures have a concrete quality to them, and we often want to the size of the effect expressed in terms of the original measure.\nLet’s talk about concrete measures some more. How about learning a musical instrument. Let’s say it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert piano, violin, or guitar player. And, let’s say you found something online that says that using their method, you will learn the instrument in less time than normal. That is a claim about the effect size of their method. You would want to know how big the effect is right? For example, the effect-size could be 10 hours. That would mean it would take you 9,980 hours to become an expert (that’s a whole 10 hours less). If I knew the effect-size was so tiny, I wouldn’t bother with their new method. But, if the effect size was say 1,000 hours, that’s a pretty big deal, that’s 10% less (still doesn’t seem like much, but saving 1,000 hours seems like a lot).\nJust as often as we have concrete measures that are readily interpretable, Psychology often produces measures that are extremely difficult to interpret. For example, questionnaire measures often have no concrete meaning, and only an abstract statistical meaning. If you wanted to know whether a manipulation caused people to more or less happy, and you used to questionnaire to measure happiness, you might find that people were 50 happy in condition 1, and 60 happy in condition 2, that’s a difference of 10 happy units. But how much is 10? Is that a big or small difference? It’s not immediately obvious. What is the solution here? A common solution is to provide a standardized measure of the difference, like a z-score. For example, if a difference of 10 reflected a shift of one standard deviation that would be useful to know, and that would be a sizeable shift. If the difference was only a .1 shift in terms of standard deviation, then the difference of 10 wouldn’t be very large. We elaborate on this idea next in describing cohen’s d.\n\n\n13.1.3 Cohen’s d\nLet’s look a few distributions to firm up some ideas about effect-size. Figure 13.1 has four panels. The first panel (0) represents the null distribution of no differences. This is the idea that your manipulation (A vs. B) doesn’t do anything at all, as a result when you measure scores in conditions A and B, you are effectively sampling scores from the very same overall distribution. The panel shows the distribution as green for condition B, but the red one for condition A is identical and drawn underneath (it’s invisible). There is 0 difference between these distributions, so it represent a null effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Each panel shows hypothetical distributions for two conditions. As the effect-size increases, the difference between the distributions become larger.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe remaining panels are hypothetical examples of what a true effect could look like, when your manipulation actually causes a difference. For example, if condition A is a control group, and condition B is a treatment group, we are looking at three cases where the treatment manipulation causes a positive shift in the mean of distribution. We are using normal curves with mean =0 and sd =1 for this demonstration, so a shift of .5 is a shift of half of a standard deviation. A shift of 1 is a shift of 1 standard deviation, and a shift of 2 is a shift of 2 standard deviations. We could draw many more examples showing even bigger shifts, or shifts that go in the other direction.\nLet’s look at another example, but this time we’ll use some concrete measurements. Let’s say we are looking at final exam performance, so our numbers are grade percentages. Let’s also say that we know the mean on the test is 65%, with a standard deviation of 5%. Group A could be a control that just takes the test, Group B could receive some “educational” manipulation designed to improve the test score. These graphs then show us some hypotheses about what the manipulation may or may not be doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: Each panel shows hypothetical distributions for two conditions. As the effect-size increases, the difference between the distributions become larger.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first panel shows that both condition A and B will sample test scores from the same distribution (mean =65, with 0 effect). The other panels show shifted mean for condition B (the treatment that is supposed to increase test performance). So, the treatment could increase the test performance by 2.5% (mean 67.5, .5 sd shift), or by 5% (mean 70, 1 sd shift), or by 10% (mean 75%, 2 sd shift), or by any other amount. In terms of our previous metaphor, a shift of 2 standard deviations is more like jack-hammer in terms of size, and a shift of .5 standard deviations is more like using a pencil. The thing about research, is we often have no clue about whether our manipulation will produce a big or small effect, that’s why we are conducting the research.\nYou might have noticed that the letter \\(d\\) appears in the above figure. Why is that? Jacob Cohen (cohen1988?) used the letter \\(d\\) in defining the effect-size for this situation, and now everyone calls it Cohen’s \\(d\\). The formula for Cohen’s \\(d\\) is:\n\\(d = \\frac{\\text{mean for condition 1} - \\text{mean for condition 2}}{\\text{population standard deviation}}\\)\nIf you notice, this is just a kind of z-score. It is a way to standardize the mean difference in terms of the population standard deviation.\nIt is also worth noting again that this measure of effect-size is entirely hypothetical for most purposes. In general, researchers do not know the population standard deviation, they can only guess at it, or estimate it from the sample. The same goes for means, in the formula these are hypothetical mean differences in two population distributions. In practice, researchers do not know these values, they guess at them from their samples.\nBefore discussing why the concept of effect-size can be useful, we note that Cohen’s \\(d\\) is useful for understanding abstract measures. For example, when you don’t know what a difference of 10 or 20 means as a raw score, you can standardize the difference by the sample standard deviation, then you know roughly how big the effect is in terms of standard units. If you thought a 20 was big, but it turned out to be only 1/10th of a standard deviation, then you would know the effect is actually quite small with respect to the overall variability in the data.",

    "section": "13.2 Power",
    "text": "13.2 Power\nWhen there is a true effect out there to measure, you want to make sure your design is sensitive enough to detect the effect, otherwise what’s the point. We’ve already talked about the idea that an effect can have different sizes. The next idea is that your design can be more less sensitive in its ability to reliabily measure the effect. We have discussed this general idea many times already in the textbook, for example we know that we will be more likely to detect “significant” effects (when there are real differences) when we increase our sample-size. Here, we will talk about the idea of design sensitivity in terms of the concept of power. Interestingly, the concept of power is a somewhat limited concept, in that it only exists as a concept within some philosophies of statistics.\n\n13.2.1 A digresssion about hypothesis testing\nIn particular, the concept of power falls out of the Neyman-Pearson concept of null vs. alternative hypothesis testing. Up to this point, we have largely avoided this terminology. This is perhaps a disservice in that the Neyman-Pearson ideas are by now the most common and widespread, and in the opinion of some of us, they are also the most widely misunderstood and abused idea, which is why we have avoided these ideas until now.\nWhat we have been mainly doing is talking about hypothesis testing from the Fisherian (Sir Ronald Fisher, the ANOVA guy) perspective. This is a basic perspective that we think can’t be easily ignored. It is also quite limited. The basic idea is this:\n\nWe know that chance can cause some differences when we measure something between experimental conditions.\nWe want to rule out the possibility that the difference that we observed can not be due to chance\nWe construct large N designs that permit us to do this when a real effect is observed, such that we can confidently say that big differences that we find are so big (well outside the chance window) that it is highly implausible that chance alone could have produced.\nThe final conclusion is that chance was extremely unlikely to have produced the differences. We then infer that something else, like the manipulation, must have caused the difference.\nWe don’t say anything else about the something else.\nWe either reject the null distribution as an explanation (that chance couldn’t have done it), or retain the null (admit that chance could have done it, and if it did we couldn’t tell the difference between what we found and what chance could do)\n\nNeyman and Pearson introduced one more idea to this mix, the idea of an alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis is the idea that if there is a true effect, then the data sampled into each condition of the experiment must have come from two different distributions. Remember, when there is no effect we assume all of the data cam from the same distribution (which by definition can’t produce true differences in the long run, because all of the numbers are coming from the same distribution). The graphs of effect-sizes from before show examples of these alternative distributions, with samples for condition A coming from one distribution, and samples from condition B coming from a shifted distribution with a different mean.\nSo, under the Neyman-Pearson tradition, when a researcher find a signifcant effect they do more than one things. First, they reject the null-hypothesis of no differences, and they accept the alternative hypothesis that there was differences. This seems like a sensible thing to do. And, because the researcher is actually interested in the properties of the real effect, they might be interested in learning more about the actual alternative hypothesis, that is they might want to know if their data come from two different distributions that were separated by some amount…in other words, they would want to know the size of the effect that they were measuring.\n\n\n13.2.2 Back to power\nWe have now discussed enough ideas to formalize the concept of statistical power. For this concept to exist we need to do a couple things.\n\nAgree to set an alpha criterion. When the p-value for our test-statistic is below this value we will call our finding statistically significant, and agree to reject the null hypothesis and accept the “alternative” hypothesis (sidenote, usually it isn’t very clear which specific alternative hypothesis was accepted)\nIn advance of conducting the study, figure out what kinds of effect-sizes our design is capable of detecting with particular probabilites.\n\nThe power of a study is determined by the relationship between\n\nThe sample-size of the study\nThe effect-size of the manipulation\nThe alpha value set by the researcher.\n\nTo see this in practice let’s do a simulation. We will do a t-test on a between-groups design 10 subjects in each group. Group A will be a control group with scores sampled from a normal distribution with mean of 10, and standard deviation of 5. Group B will be a treatment group, we will say the treatment has an effect-size of Cohen’s \\(d\\) = .5, that’s a standard deviation shift of .5, so the scores with come from a normal distribution with mean =12.5 and standard deivation of 5. Remember 1 standard deviation here is 5, so half of a standard deviation is 2.5.\nThe following R script runs this simulated experiment 1000 times. We set the alpha criterion to .05, this means we will reject the null whenever the \\(p\\)-value is less than .05. With this specific design, how many times out of of 1000 do we reject the null, and accept the alternative hypothesis?\n\n#&gt; [1] 171\n\nThe answer is that we reject the null, and accept the alternative 171 times out of 1000. In other words our experiment succesfully accepts the alternative hypothesis 17.1 percent of the time, this is known as the power of the study. Power is the probability that a design will succesfully detect an effect of a specific size.\nImportantly, power is completely abstract idea that is completely determined by many assumptions including N, effect-size, and alpha. As a result, it is best not to think of power as a single number, but instead as a family of numbers.\nFor example, power is different when we change N. If we increase N, our samples will more precisely estimate the true distributions that they came from. Increasing N reduces sampling error, and shrinks the range of differences that can be produced by chance. Lets’ increase our N in this simulation from 10 to 20 in each group and see what happens.\n\n#&gt; [1] 324\n\nNow the number of significant experiments i 324 out of 1000, or a power of 32.4 percent. That’s roughly doubled from before. We have made the design more sensitive to the effect by increasing N.\nWe can change the power of the design by changing the alpha-value, which tells us how much evidence we need to reject the null. For example, if we set the alpha criterion to 0.01, then we will be more conservative, only rejecting the null when chance can produce the observed difference 1% of the time. In our example, this will have the effect of reducing power. Let’s keep N at 20, but reduce the alpha to 0.01 and see what happens:\n\n#&gt; [1] 142\n\nNow only 142 out of 1000 experiments are significant, that’s 14.2 power.\nFinally, the power of the design depends on the actual size of the effect caused by the manipulation. In our example, we hypothesized that the effect caused a shift of .5 standard deviations. What if the effect causes a bigger shift? Say, a shift of 2 standard deviations. Let’s keep N= 20, and alpha &lt; .01, but change the effect-size to two standard deviations. When the effect in the real-world is bigger, it should be easier to measure, so our power will increase.\n\n#&gt; [1] 1000\n\nNeat, if the effect-size is actually huge (2 standard deviation shift), then we have power 100 percent to detect the true effect.\n\n\n13.2.3 Power curves\nWe mentioned that it is best to think of power as a family of numbers, rather than as a single number. To elaborate on this consider the power curve below. This is the power curve for a specific design: a between groups experiments with two levels, that uses an independent samples t-test to test whether an observed difference is due to chance. Critically, N is set to 10 in each group, and alpha is set to .05\nIn Figure 13.3 power (as a proportion, not a percentage) is plotted on the y-axis, and effect-size (Cohen’s d) in standard deviation units is plotted on the x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: This figure shows power as a function of effect-size (Cohen’s d) for a between-subjects independent samples t-test, with N=10, and alpha criterion 0.05.\n\n\n\n\n\nA power curve like this one is very helpful to understand the sensitivity of a particular design. For example, we can see that a between subjects design with N=10 in both groups, will detect an effect of d=.5 (half a standard deviation shift) about 20% of the time, will detect an effect of d=.8 about 50% of the time, and will detect an effect of d=2 about 100% of the time. All of the percentages reflect the power of the design, which is the percentage of times the design would be expected to find a \\(p\\) &lt; 0.05.\nLet’s imagine that based on prior research, the effect you are interested in measuring is fairly small, d=0.2. If you want to run an experiment that will detect an effect of this size a large percentage of the time, how many subjects do you need to have in each group? We know from the above graph that with N=10, power is very low to detect an effect of d=0.2. Let’s make Figure 13.4 and vary the number of subjects rather than the size of the effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: This figure shows power as a function of N for a between-subjects independent samples t-test, with d=0.2, and alpha criterion 0.05.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure plots power to detect an effect of d=0.2, as a function of N. The green line shows where power = .8, or 80%. It looks like we would nee about 380 subjects in each group to measure an effect of d=0.2, with power = .8. This means that 80% of our experiments would succesfully show p &lt; 0.05. Often times power of 80% is recommended as a reasonable level of power, however even when your design has power = 80%, your experiment will still fail to find an effect (associated with that level of power) 20% of the time!",

    "section": "13.4 Some considerations",
    "text": "13.4 Some considerations\n\n13.4.1 Low powered studies\nConsider the following case. A researcher runs a study to detect an effect of interest. There is good reason, from prior research, to believe the effect-size is d=0.5. The researcher uses a design that has 30% power to detect the effect. They run the experiment and find a significant p-value, (p&lt;.05). They conclude their manipulation worked, because it was unlikely that their result could have been caused by chance. How would you interpret the results of a study like this? Would you agree with thte researchers that the manipulation likely caused the difference? Would you be skeptical of the result?\nThe situation above requires thinking about two kinds of probabilities. On the one hand we know that the result observed by the researchers does not occur often by chance (p is less than 0.05). At the same time, we know that the design was underpowered, it only detects results of the expected size 30% of the time. We are face with wondering what kind of luck was driving the difference. The researchers could have gotten unlucky, and the difference really could be due to chance. In this case, they would be making a type I error (saying the result is real when it isn’t). If the result was not due to chance, then they would also be lucky, as their design only detects this effect 30% of the time.\nPerhaps another way to look at this situation is in terms of the replicability of the result. Replicability refers to whether or not the findings of the study would be the same if the experiment was repeated. Because we know that power is low here (only 30%), we would expect that most replications of this experiment would not find a significant effect. Instead, the experiment would be expected to replicate only 30% of the time.\n\n\n13.4.2 Large N and small effects\nPerhaps you have noticed that there is an intriguiing relationship between N (sample-size) and power and effect-size. As N increases, so does power to detect an effect of a particular size. Additionally, as N increases, a design is capable of detecting smaller and smaller effects with greater and greater power. For example, if N was large enough, we would have high power to detect very small effects, say d= 0.01, or even d=0.001. Let’s think about what this means.\nImagine a drug company told you that they ran an experiment with 1 billion people to test whether their drug causes a significant change in headache pain. Let’s say they found a significant effect (with power =100%), but the effect was very small, it turns out the drug reduces headache pain by less than 1%, let’s say 0.01%. For our imaginary study we will also assume that this effect is very real, and not caused by chance.\nClearly the design had enough power to detect the effect, and the effect was there, so the design did detect the effect. However, the issue is that there is little practical value to this effect. Nobody is going to by a drug to reduce their headache pain by 0.01%, even if it was “scientifcally proven” to work. This example brings up two issues. First, increasing N to very large levels will allow designs to detect almost any effect (even very tiny ones) with very high power. Second, sometimes effects are meaningless when they are very small, especially in applied research such as drug studies.\nThese two issues can lead to interesting suggestions. For example, someone might claim that large N studies aren’t very useful, because they can always detect really tiny effects that are practically meaningless. On the other hand, large N studies will also detect larger effects too, and they will give a better estimate of the “true” effect in the population (because we know that larger samples do a better job of estimating population parameters). Additionally, although really small effects are often not interesting in the context of applied research, they can be very important in theoretical research. For example, one theory might predict that manipulating X should have no effect, but another theory might predict that X does have an effect, even if it is a small one. So, detecting a small effect can have theoretical implication that can help rule out false theories. Generally speaking, researchers asking both theoretical and applied questions should think about and establish guidelines for “meaningful” effect-sizes so that they can run designs of appropriate size to detect effects of “meaningful size”.\n\n\n13.4.3 Small N and Large effects\nAll other things being equal would you trust the results from a study with small N or large N? This isn’t a trick question, but sometimes people tie themselves into a knot trying to answer it. We already know that large sample-sizes provide better estimates of the distributions the samples come from. As a result, we can safely conclude that we should trust the data from large N studies more than small N studies.\nAt the same time, you might try to convince yourself otherwise. For example, you know that large N studies can detect very small effects that are practically and possibly even theoretically meaningless. You also know that that small N studies are only capable of reliably detecting very large effects. So, you might reason that a small N study is better than a large N study because if a small N study detects an effect, that effect must be big and meaningful; whereas, a large N study could easily detect an effect that is tiny and meaningless.\nThis line of thinking needs some improvement. First, just because a large N study can detect small effects, doesn’t mean that it only detects small effects. If the effect is large, a large N study will easily detect it. Large N studies have the power to detect a much wider range of effects, from small to large. Second, just because a small N study detected an effect, does not mean that the effect is real, or that the effect is large. For example, small N studies have more variability, so the estimate of the effect size will have more error. Also, there is 5% (or alpha rate) chance that the effect was spurious. Interestingly, there is a pernicious relationship between effect-size and type I error rate\n\n\n13.4.4 Type I errors are convincing when N is small\nSo what is this pernicious relationship between Type I errors and effect-size? Mainly, this relationship is pernicious for small N studies. For example, the following figure illustrates the results of 1000s of simulated experiments, all assuming the null distribution. In other words, for all of these simulations there is no true effect, as the numbers are all sampled from an identical distribution (normal distribution with mean =0, and standard deviation =1). The true effect-size is 0 in all cases.\nWe know that under the null, researchers will find p values that are less 5% about 5% of the time, remember that is the definition. So, if a researcher happened to be in this situation (where there manipulation did absolutely nothing), they would make a type I error 5% of the time, or if they conducted 100 experiments, they would expect to find a significant result for 5 of them.\nFigure 13.5 reports the findings from only the type I errors, where the simulated study did produce p &lt; 0.05. For each type I error, we calculated the exact p-value, as well as the effect-size (cohen’s D) (mean difference divided by standard deviation). We already know that the true effect-size is zero, however take a look at this graph, and pay close attention to the smaller sample-sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.5: Effect size as a function of p-values for type 1 Errors under the null, for a paired samples t-test.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, look at the red dots, when sample size is 10. Here we see that the effect-sizes are quite large. When p is near 0.05 the effect-size is around .8, and it goes up and up as when p gets smaller and smaller. What does this mean? It means that when you get unlucky with a small N design, and your manipulation does not work, but you by chance find a “significant” effect, the effect-size measurement will show you a “big effect”. This is the pernicious aspect. When you make a type I error for small N, your data will make you think there is no way it could be a type I error because the effect is just so big!. Notice that when N is very large, like 1000, the measure of effect-size approaches 0 (which is the true effect-size in the simulation shown in Figure 13.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.6: Each panel shows a histogram of a different sampling statistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarnes, Mallory L. 2023.

According to definition, these correlations only arise from random normal deviates 5% of the time, but when they do arise for small sample sizes, they look fairly convincing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nall_df&lt;-data.frame()\nfor(n in c(10,50,100,1000)){\n  count_sims&lt;-0\n  for(sim in 1:1000){\n    North_pole &lt;- rnorm(n,0,1)\n    South_pole &lt;- rnorm(n,0,1)\n    if(cor.test(North_pole,South_pole)$p.value&lt;.05){\n      count_sims&lt;-count_sims+1\n    t_df&lt;-data.frame(nsize=rep(n,n),\n                     simulation=rep(count_sims,n),\n                     North_pole,\n                     South_pole)\n    all_df&lt;-rbind(all_df,t_df)\n    \n    if(count_sims==10){\n      break\n    }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nggplot(all_df,aes(x=North_pole,y=South_pole))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=TRUE)+\n  theme_classic()+\n  facet_wrap(~nsize)+\n  transition_states(\n    simulation,\n    transition_length = 2,\n    state_length = 1\n  )+enter_fade() + \n  exit_shrink() +\n  ease_aes('sine-in-out')\n\n\n\n14.1.6 Cell-size and correlation\nThis simulation illustrates how the behavior of correlating two random normal samples as a function of cell-size. The sample-size is always set at N=10. For each panel, the simulation uses an increasing cell-size to estimate the mean for X and Y. When cell-size is 1, 10 X and Y values are drawn from the same normal (u=0, sd=1). When cell-size is 5, for each X,Y score in the plot, 5 samples were drawn from the same normal, and then the mean of the samples is plotted. The effect of cell-size shrinks the dot cloud, as both X and Y scores provide better estimates of the population mean = 0. Cell-size has no effect on the behavior of r, which swings around because sample-size N is small. These are all random, so there is always a 5% type I error rate (alpha =.05).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nget_sampling_means&lt;-function(m,sd,cell_size,s_size){\n  save_means&lt;-length(s_size)\n  for(i in 1:s_size){\n    save_means[i]&lt;-mean(rnorm(cell_size,m,sd))\n  }\n  return(save_means)\n}\n\nall_df&lt;-data.frame()\nfor(n in c(1,5,10,100)){\n  count_sims&lt;-0\n  for(sim in 1:10){\n    North_pole &lt;- get_sampling_means(0,1,n,10)\n    South_pole &lt;- get_sampling_means(0,1,n,10)\n      count_sims&lt;-count_sims+1\n      t_df&lt;-data.frame(nsize=rep(n,10),\n                       simulation=rep(count_sims,10),\n                       North_pole,\n                       South_pole)\n      all_df&lt;-rbind(all_df,t_df)\n  }\n}\n\n\nggplot(all_df,aes(x=North_pole,y=South_pole))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=TRUE)+\n  theme_classic()+\n  facet_wrap(~nsize)+\n  ggtitle(\"Random scatterplots, N=10, Cell-size = 1,5,10,100\")+\n  transition_states(\n    simulation,\n    transition_length = 2,\n    state_length = 1\n  )+enter_fade() + \n  exit_shrink() +\n  ease_aes('sine-in-out')\n\n\n\n14.1.7 Regression\nWe look at how the residuals (error from points to line) behave as the regression lines moves above and below it’s true value. The total error associated with all of the red lines is represents by the grey area. This total error is smallest (minimized) when the black line overlaps with the blue regression line (the best fit line). The total error expands as the black line moves away from the regression. That’s why the regression line is the least wrong (best fit) line to skewer the data (according to least squares definition)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd &lt;- mtcars\nfit &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = d)\nd$predicted &lt;- predict(fit)   # Save the predicted values\nd$residuals &lt;- residuals(fit) # Save the residual values\n\ncoefs&lt;-coef(lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars))\ncoefs[1]\ncoefs[2]\n\nx&lt;-d$hp\nmove_line&lt;-c(seq(-6,6,.5),seq(6,-6,-.5))\ntotal_error&lt;-length(length(move_line))\ncnt&lt;-0\nfor(i in move_line){\n  cnt&lt;-cnt+1\n  predicted_y &lt;- coefs[2]*x + coefs[1]+i\n  error_y &lt;- (predicted_y-d$mpg)^2\n  total_error[cnt]&lt;-sqrt(sum(error_y)/32)\n}\n\nmove_line_sims&lt;-rep(move_line,each=32)\ntotal_error_sims&lt;-rep(total_error,each=32)\nsims&lt;-rep(1:50,each=32)\n\nd&lt;-d %&gt;% slice(rep(row_number(), 50))\n\nd&lt;-cbind(d,sims,move_line_sims,total_error_sims)\n\n\nanim&lt;-ggplot(d, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, frame=sims)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"lightblue\") +  \n  geom_abline(intercept = 30.09886+move_line_sims, slope = -0.06822828)+\n  lims(x = c(0,400), y = c(-10,40))+\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = hp, yend = predicted+move_line_sims, color=\"red\"), alpha = .5) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = predicted+move_line_sims - total_error_sims, ymax = predicted+move_line_sims + total_error_sims), fill = \"lightgrey\", alpha=.2)+ \n  theme_classic()+\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")+\n  xlab(\"X\")+ylab(\"Y\")+\n  transition_manual(frames=sims)+\n  enter_fade() + \n  exit_fade()+\n  ease_aes('sine-in-out')\n\nanimate(anim,fps=5)",

Vertical blue line is mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean.\nNote: for purposes of the animation (and because it was easier to do this way), the histograms for the sampling distribution of the sample means have different sizes. When sample-size = 10, the histogram shows 10 sample means. When sample size=100, the histogram shows 100 sample means. I could have simulated many more sample means (say 10000) for each, but then the histograms for the sample means would be static.\nThe y-axis is very rough.

    "text": "14.3 Statistical Inference\n\n14.3.1 Randomization Test\nThis is an attempt at visualizing a randomization test. Samples are taken under two conditions of the IV (A and B). At the beginning of the animation, the original scores in the first condition are shown as green dots on the left, and the original scores in the second condition are the red dots on the right. The means for each group are the purple dots. During the randomization, the original scores are shuffled randomly between the two conditions. After each shuffle, two new means are computed and displayed as the yellow dots. This occurs either for all permutations, or for a large random sample of them. The animation shows the original scores being shuffled around across the randomizations (the colored dots switch their original condition, appearing from side to side).\nFor intuitive inference, one might look at the range of motion of the yellow dots. This is how the mean difference between group 1 and group 2 behaves under randomization. It’s what chance can do. If the difference between the purple dots is well outside the range of motion of the yellow dots, then the mean difference observed in the beginning is not likely produced by chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstudy&lt;-round(runif(10,80,100))\nno_study&lt;-round(runif(10,40,90))\n\nstudy_df&lt;-data.frame(student=seq(1:10),study,no_study)\nmean_original&lt;-data.frame(IV=c(\"studied\",\"didnt_study\"),\n                          means=c(mean(study),mean(no_study)))\nt_df&lt;-data.frame(sims=rep(1,20),\n                 IV=rep(c(\"studied\",\"didnt_study\"),each=10),\n                 values=c(study,no_study),\n                 rand_order=rep(c(0,1),each=10))\n\nraw_df&lt;-t_df\nfor(i in 2:10){\n  new_index&lt;-sample(1:20)\n  t_df$values&lt;-t_df$values[new_index]\n  t_df$rand_order&lt;-t_df$rand_order[new_index]\n  t_df$sims&lt;-rep(i,20)\n  raw_df&lt;-rbind(raw_df,t_df)\n}\n\nraw_df$rand_order&lt;-as.factor(raw_df$rand_order)\nrand_df&lt;-aggregate(values~sims*IV,raw_df,mean)\nnames(rand_df)&lt;-c(\"sims\",\"IV\",\"means\")\n\n\na&lt;-ggplot(raw_df,aes(x=IV,y=values,color=rand_order,size=3))+\n  geom_point(stat=\"identity\",alpha=.5)+\n  geom_point(data=mean_original,aes(x=IV,y=means),stat=\"identity\",shape=21,size=6,color=\"black\",fill=\"mediumorchid2\")+\n  geom_point(data=rand_df,aes(x=IV,y=means),stat=\"identity\",shape=21,size=6,color=\"black\",fill=\"gold\")+\n  theme_classic(base_size = 15)+\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(40, 100))+\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Randomization test: Original Means (purple), \n          \\n Randomized means (yellow)\n          \\n Original scores (red,greenish)\")+\n  transition_states(\n    sims,\n    transition_length = 1,\n    state_length = 2\n  )+enter_fade() + \n  exit_shrink() +\n  ease_aes('sine-in-out')\n\nanimate(a,nframes=100,fps=5)\n\n\n\n14.3.2 Independent t-test Null\nThis is a simulation of the null distribution for an independent samples t-test, two groups, 10 observations per group.\nThis animation has two panels.
