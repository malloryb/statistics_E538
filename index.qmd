# Preface {.unnumbered}

First Draft (version 0.0 = August 14th, 2023) 

Welcome to the first edition of this Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook, specifically adapted to the needs of Environmental Science students enrolled in the SPEA E-538 statistics course at Indiana University (IU).

This textbook is an adaptation of a thorough introductory statistics textbook originally developed for undergraduate Psychology students by Matthew Crump and colleagues (refer to Acknowledgements for more details). As part of IU's Course Materials Fellowship Program ([CMFP](https://libraries.indiana.edu/course-material-fellowship-program-1)), I've had the opportunity to mold this material, refining it to serve as a specialized resource for students studying Environmental Science.

### Acknowledgements

I wish to express my deepest appreciation to the contributors of the original textbook, without whom this adaptation would not have been possible. I am deeply grateful for the expertise and vision of Matthew Crump, Alla Chavarga, Anjali Krishnan, Jeffrey Suzuki, and Stephen Volz. Their exceptional groundwork laid the foundation for this project.

My heartfelt thanks also go to the Course Materials Fellowship Program (CMFP) at Indiana University (IU), which has been instrumental in supporting this adaptation effort. The CMFP is an initiative designed to incentivize the discovery, implementation, and creation of cost-effective course materials. Its aim is to foster the use of Open Educational Resources (OERs)---freely accessible and customizable learning materials that make education more equitable and accessible.

I am particularly grateful to Sarah Hare, the Bloomington lead for the CMFP program, and Adam Mazel, a digital publishing librarian at IU. Their guidance, expertise, and steadfast support have been crucial to this project's success. Their contributions to the advancement of affordable and accessible education are truly commendable.

## Copying the textbook

This textbook was written in R-Studio, using R Markdown, and compiled into a web-book format using the bookdown package. In general, I thank the larger R community for all of the amazing tools they made, and for making those tools open, so that I could use them to make this thing.

All of the source code for compiling the book is available from the GitHub repository for the original textbook:

<https://github.com/CrumpLab/statistics>

and my github repository:

<https://github.com/malloryb/statistics_E538>

In principle, anybody could fork or otherwise download the E-538 textbook, or the original textbook, which is what I did. Load the Rproj file in R-studio, and then compile the entire book. Then, the individual .rmd files for each chapter could be edited for content and style to better suit your needs.

If you want to contribute to this version of the textbook, you could make pull requests on GitHub, or discuss issues and request on the issues tab.

### The vision behind this textbook

The goal of this textbook is twofold. First, it aims to make complex statistical concepts accessible and digestible for students in Environmental Science. Second, it hopes to promote the usage of open-source tools like R, recognizing their value in today's data-driven world.
